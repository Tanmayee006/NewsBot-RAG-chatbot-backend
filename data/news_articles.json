The private equity firm announced in June it would spend £370bn across Europe over 10 years.Microsoft pledged to spend £22bn in the UK over the next four years, while Google will invest £5bn over the next two years to expand an existing data centre in Hertfordshire.While it is thought the investments will generate thousands of jobs in the years ahead, the number of people on UK payrolls has fallen by an estimated 127,000 employees in the year to August, according to the Office for National Statistics.Meanwhile, Britain's life sciences sector has sustained a number of blows in recent days.US giant Merck rowed back on a plan to invest £1bn in the UK after blaming successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines. Instead, it will move research to the US.AstraZeneca then paused plans to invest £200m at a Cambridge research site, a project expected to create 1,000 jobs. It has also switched investment to the US.Where is the investment going?Blackstone's large investment is in addition to the £10bn it previously announced for data centre development in the UK.Real estate investment trust Prologis is also set to invest £3.9bn into the UK's life sciences and advanced manufacturing.Palantir will invest up to £1.5bn in UK defence innovation and plans to create up to 350 new jobs.American tech company Amentum plans to create more than 3,000 jobs and expand its UK workforce by more than 50%.Boeing has said it will convert two 737 aircraft in Birmingham for the US Air Force, which would be the first USAF aircraft built in the UK for more than 50 years, and could create 150 high-skilled jobs.US Engineering firm STAX has also committed up to £38m to expand its UK operations.The 7,600 total jobs promised are intended to be in all areas of the UK.This is set to include 1,000 new jobs in Belfast and 6,000 more roles from Glasgow to Warrington, the Midlands and the north-east of England.Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the deal reflects growing confidence in the UK's industrial strategy.\"These record-breaking investments will create thousands of high-quality jobs across the UK,\" he said.The government said it wants to give \"real opportunities for working people\", including apprenticeships in clean energy and careers in biotech and AI.This comes ahead of the signing of the Tech Prosperity Deal on Thursday, which is an agreement to accelerate the building of new nuclear power in both the US and the UK.UK-US relations",

    "content": "Jimmy Kimmel taken off air over Charlie Kirk comments4 hours agoShareSaveNardine SaadLos AngelesShareSave'Ultimate in cancel culture': Fans outside Jimmy Kimmel studio react to shows axingABC has pulled late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off air indefinitely over comments he made about the shooting of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.\"Jimmy Kimmel Live will be pre-empted indefinitely,\" a spokesperson for the Disney-owned network said in a statement. Earlier this week, Kimmel said during his show that the \"Maga gang\" was trying to score political points off Kirk's killing.Kimmel did not comment to the BBC as he emerged shortly after the announcement from the television studio in Los Angeles.Celebrating the announcement, President Donald Trump said it was \"great news for America\".Kimmel said in his Monday night monologue: \"The Maga Gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"The late-night host also criticised flags being flown at half mast in honour of Kirk, and mocked US President Donald Trump's reaction to the shooting.\"This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish,\" said Kimmel, who has often poked fun at Trump.On the day Kirk was shot, Kimmel took to Instagram to condemn the attack and send \"love\" to the 31-year-old activist's family.A suspect, 22, has since appeared in court charged with aggravated murder.Shortly after ABC announced Kimmel had been suspended, President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post: \"The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"Who is Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for shooting Charlie Kirk?Is this the death of the late night US chat show?After he was taken off air, Kimmel left the show's studio on Hollywood Boulevard wearing a flannel shirt and cap and rode away in a car without comment.Fans of the show, who had been queuing up to join the live audience, expressed disappointment about the cancellation.Janna Blackwell, who was on holiday from Virginia, told the BBC: \"You know, this is getting ridiculous and stupid.\"Freedom of speech. He shared his opinion and is being cancelled. To me that is bizarre.\"A small protest was also held outside the studio with a sign saying \"Trump must go now\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe ABC announcement came just after one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, Nexstar Media, said it would not air Jimmy Kimmel Live! \"for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show\".Nexstar said the comedian's remarks about Kirk were \"offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse\".\"[We] do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,\" said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division.The chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, thanked Nexstar \"for doing the right thing\" and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead. Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for its planned $6.2bn merger with Tegna.Sinclair, the largest ABC affiliate group in the US, followed suit. It said it would air a special remembrance programme dedicated to Kirk this Friday during the original time slot for Kimmel's show.FCC head Carr, a Trump appointee, had earlier criticised Kimmel's monologue.The head of the US communications regulator said on Wednesday that the ABC host had shown \"the sickest conduct possible\" and he urged Disney to take action.\"[Broadcasters] have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,\" the Trump appointee told the Benny Show, a conservative podcast.He noted that an apology from Kimmel would be a \"very reasonable, minimal step\".But Anna Gomez, the only Democratic member of the FCC, criticised Carr's remarks.She posted on X that \"an inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship or control\".The Writers Guild of America (WGA), Hollywood's labour union, condemned the decision to take Kimmel off air as a violation of constitutional free speech rights.\"Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth,\" it said in a statement. Sag-Aftra, another union, said the move was \"the type of suppression and retaliation that endangers everyone's freedoms\".A person familiar with Kimmel's situation told CNBC that the host had not been fired, adding that bosses at the network intended to speak to the comedian about what he should say when he goes back on air.Kimmel is the latest late-night host to see his programme run into issues as more viewers turn to streaming over traditional network viewing.In July, rival network CBS announced it would end The Late Show With Stephen Colbert next year after 11 seasons.Network executives said the move was \"not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount\".However, Colbert tore into the network and its parent company over the decision.He accused CBS of leaking financial figures to the press, and alluded to a $16m (£13.5m) settlement with Trump after he sued the network over an interview its 60 Minutes programme did last year with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.That payout came several months after the Disney-owned ABC agreed to pay $15m (£12m) to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit after its star anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely and repeatedly said during an interview that the president had been found \"liable for rape\".A jury in a civil case had determined Trump was liable for \"sexual abuse\", which has a specific definition under New York law.With additional reporting from Regan Morris in Los Angeles.Charlie Kirk murder suspect appears in court, with prosecutors seeking death penaltyReport those who celebrate Charlie Kirk death to employers, Vance saysDonald TrumpUtahUnited States",

    "content": "Katty Kay: Why America is at a dangerous crossroads following the Charlie Kirk shooting 3 hours agoShareSaveKatty KayUS Special Correspondent ShareSaveBBCIt has been a brutal week in America and I'm not the only one wondering whether the country can pull itself out of this spiral of hatred and violence.After one of the most searing assassinations in US history, the governor of Utah pleaded for Americans to turn down the political temperature. But hardly anyone that I've spoken to since Charlie Kirk's death thinks that will be the path the country will choose. Not anytime soon, at least.Recent history is full of examples where America has chosen not to come together after a tragedy. It didn't happen 14 years ago after a Democratic congresswoman was shot in the head in Arizona. Nor eight years ago, when a Republican congressman was shot during baseball practice.Americans didn't even come together in the face of a global pandemic. In fact, Covid made divisions worse.OLIVIER TOURON/AFP via Getty ImagesWithin days of Charlie Kirk's death, the country's political camps had already retreated to opposing narrativesThe reason is simple, yet hard to change. The incentives that fuel American political life reward the people and platforms that turn up the heat, not those who dial tensions down.Around the country, you're more likely to get elected to political office if you run on policies and rhetoric that appeal to your political base, rather than the political middle (it's the depressing byproduct of gerrymandering - the original sin behind America's dysfunctional, divided politics).Equally, in the media, people who opine about politics are rewarded for being more extreme and stoking outrage — that's the way to get more eyeballs and, ultimately, more advertising dollars.This incentive structure is what makes Utah Governor Spencer Cox something of an American exception.REUTERS/Cheney OrrUtah Governor Spencer Cox has tried to turn down the political temperatureAfter Charlie Kirk was killed, he urged Americans to \"log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in the community\".He sounded so sane, so wholesome - an effort, in a sea of division, at reconciliation.The 1960s and 70s versus todayDivision and political violence are not new phenomena in America. Some 160 years ago, the country went to war with itself and it has never really stopped.Over a period of five years in the 1960s, a US president was killed and then his brother was killed while campaigning to become president. In that same period, two of the nation's most prominent civil rights leaders were assassinated too.In the 1970s, President Gerald Ford was shot at on two separate occasions. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan was struck by a bullet while walking to his limousine.Heritage Space/Heritage Images via Getty ImagesPresident John F Kennedy was shot during a visit to Dallas, Texas in November 1963 - the case still inspires conspiracy theoriesAnd of course, just last year Trump was the victim of a failed attempt on his life by a gunman in Pennsylvania — and a second alleged attempt by a gunman in Florida, whose trial began the week Kirk was killed.What makes this era so different from the 1960s and 70s, though, is what Governor Cox is worried about. While he has carefully steered away from saying things that would further divide Americans, he hasn't been so gentle with the social media companies that he clearly blames for this tragedy.\"I believe that social media has played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years,\" Cox said in an interview on Sunday.He went on to say that \"cancer\" was likely too weak a word for what it has done to American society.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesTrump was the victim of a failed attempt on his life by a gunman in PennsylvaniaMost tech companies have stayed quiet in their official capacities. However, Elon Musk, billionaire boss of X, has weighed in, claiming that the \"radical left celebrated the cold-blooded murder of Charlie Kirk,\" and adding, \"unity is impossible with evil fanatics who celebrate murder\".He has also posted about the impact of social media, arguing: \"While at times the discussion on X can become negative, it's still good that there is a discussion happening.\"'This is like a bad marriage'The pitfalls of this system that blends social media with politics concerns even those who are the most passionate about politics, regardless of who they support.Earlier this week, Kaitlin Griffiths, a 19-year-old who is the president of Utah State University's chapter of Charlie Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA, put it plainly: \"Social media is definitely a really difficult thing for our society.\"You can't even hold a conversation with somebody who doesn't agree with your political beliefs — and I just think that's honestly tragic.\"Tragic and ironic, since Kirk saw himself as a champion of free speech, even as his critics often disagreed with that framing. His death though may push the country further from civil discourse.Kaitlin Griffiths: 'You can't even hold a conversation with somebody who doesn't agree with your political beliefs... that's honestly tragic'Within days of Kirk's death, the country's political camps had already retreated to opposing narratives.Many on the left are eager to explore the ways that Kirk's killer might have been radicalised by internet subcultures and group chats. Many on the right prefer to unpack whether the suspect was part of a left-wing conspiracy.Neither group seems particularly keen to prioritise reconciliation or healing.The reality is that those who study extremism believe that left-right may not even be the most helpful way to look at the division of this current moment.Samuel Corum/Getty ImagesCharlie Kirk and and his wife Erika pictured in January at the Turning Point USA Inaugural-Eve Ball in Washington DC\"It's better to look at what's causing people to be ungovernable,\" says Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who specialises in polarised democracies.\"It does take a desire to turn down the temperature… [and] requires people to have a little more courage than they're showing.\"I think it is more useful to focus on how we as a society turn a page and open a new chapter, because this is like a bad marriage. And like a bad marriage, you can only lose by pointing fingers.\"What reconciliation would takeAs for the question of whether America can break the hold of the algorithms that stoke the divisions, that would take a leader of enormous strength with an equally enormous commitment to reconciliation.\"I'm not sure how we pull out of this,\" the politics writer David Drucker told me. \"It would help if both parties - and by parties I mean 'parties' not just political figures - agree to stop the recriminations and just say 'stop'.\"\"Usually only a president can facilitate that. Absent both sides agreeing there are certain lines that shouldn't be crossed, or absent the next president doing so, I'm not sure how we get there.\"SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty ImagesTrump has said: 'The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime... The radicals on the left are the problem'Trump is not that type of president. He often seems at his strongest, politically, when he has an adversary to fight against. My understanding is that Trump does believe that people on the left want to destroy his Maga movement. And since Kirk's death, he has taken a very different tone from the governor of Utah.\"I'll tell you something that's going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less,\" he said, when asked how the nation can be fixed. \"The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime... The radicals on the left are the problem.\"And he went further in his Oval Office remarks following Kirk's killing: \"Radical left political violence has hurt too man...",

    "content": "Macrons to offer 'scientific evidence' to US court to prove Brigitte is a woman, lawyer says2 hours agoShareSaveAnoushka Mutanda-Dougherty,Melanie Stewart-Smith andVictoria FarncombeFame Under Fire podcastShareSaveGetty ImagesEmmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, are planning to present photographic and scientific evidence to a US court to prove Mrs Macron is a woman.Their lawyer says the French president and Mrs Macron will present the documentation in a defamation suit they have taken against the right-wing influencer Candace Owens after she promoted her belief that Brigitte Macron was born male.Ms Owens' lawyers have responded with a motion to dismiss the claim.Speaking to the BBC's Fame Under Fire podcast, the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, said Mrs Macron had found the claims \"incredibly upsetting\" and they were a \"distraction\" to the French president.\"I don't want to suggest that it somehow has thrown him off his game. But just like anybody who is juggling a career and a family life as well, when your family is under attack, it wears on you. And he's not immune from that because he's the president of a country,\" he said.Mr Clare said there would be \"expert testimony that will come out that will be scientific in nature\" and while he would not reveal, at this stage, its exact nature, he said the couple were prepared to demonstrate fully \"both generically and specifically\" that the allegations are false.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.\"It is a process that she will have to subject herself to in a very public way. But she's willing to do it. She is firmly resolved to do what it takes to set the record straight.\"If that unpleasantness and that discomfort that she has of opening herself up in that way is what it takes to set a record straight and stop this, she's 100% ready to meet that burden.\"The Macrons' lawyer Tom Clare says the couple find the allegations upsetting and can demonstrate they are falseWhen asked if the Macrons would be supplying pictures of Brigitte pregnant and raising her children, Mr Clare said they existed and would be presented in court where there are rules and standards.Ms Owens, a former commentator for conservative US outlet Daily Wire who has millions of followers on social media, has repeatedly promoted her view that Brigitte Macron is a man.In March 2024, she claimed she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on the allegation.The allegation originated in fringe online spaces years earlier, notably through a 2021 YouTube video by French bloggers Amandine Roy and Natacha Rey.The Macrons initially won a defamation case in France against Roy and Rey in 2024, but that ruling was overturned on appeal in 2025 on freedom of expression grounds, not on the basis of truth. The Macrons are appealing the decision.In July, the Macrons filed a lawsuit against Ms Owens in the US. It alleges she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".In American defamation cases against public figures, plaintiffs are required to prove \"actual malice\" - that the defendant knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.Candace OwensCandace Owens has repeated her claim that Brigitte Macron is a man, on YouTube and social mediaIn August, Emmanuel Macron explained to French magazine, Paris Match, why they had chosen to pursue legal action.\"This is about defending my honour! Because this is nonsense. This is someone who knew full well that she had false information and did so with the aim of causing harm, in the service of an ideology and with established connections to far-right leaders.\"Ms Owens' lawyers have responded to the Macrons' lawsuit with a motion to dismiss, arguing that the case should not have been filed in Delaware, as she says it does not relate to her businesses, which are incorporated in the state. They claim forcing her to defend the case in Delaware would cause \"substantial financial and operational hardship\".The BBC has approached Candace Owens' legal team for a comment. She has previously said she believes what she is saying is true and there is nothing more American than free speech and the ability to criticise.Macrons file defamation suit against US influencer Candace OwensTwo women guilty of slandering Brigitte MacronFrench politicsDelawareEmmanuel MacronTennessee",

    "content": "Interest rates expected to be held by Bank of England8 hours agoShareSaveKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentShareSaveGetty ImagesInterest rates are widely expected to be held at 4% when policymakers at the Bank of England meet on Thursday.The Bank rate, which heavily influences borrowing costs and savings rates, was cut from 4.25% to 4% by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its last meeting in August.It took the rate down to its lowest level for more than two years, but many analysts believe there will be no further cuts during the rest of this year.The decision will be revealed at 12:00 BST and comes after official data on Wednesday showed prices were rising at nearly twice the target level, driven by the higher cost of food. The rate of inflation remained at 3.8% in August, well above the 2% target. The Bank rate is policymakers' main tool for controlling inflation. In theory, making borrowing more expensive means people have less money to spend, which slows prices rises. However, increasing borrowing costs can also harm the economy.Closely-watched voteThe decision to cut the Bank rate in August was taken after an unprecedented second vote by the nine members of the MPC.Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank, said the decision to cut interest rates was \"finely balanced\".Analysts expect Thursday's vote to be more clear cut, with no change expected.The relatively high rate of inflation means policymakers are unlikely to risk pushing that higher by cutting the Bank rate. However, they do expect the inflation rate to start to drop soon, which leaves the possibility open of further interest rate cuts.The Bank rate has a big impact on the interest homeowners face when taking out a new fixed-rate mortgage.Lenders use the Bank rate to set their own rates. As a result, the expectation of interest rate rises can push up mortgage rates while the expectation of interest rate cuts can pull mortgage rates down.Mortgage rates have dropped very slightly since the MPC's last meeting in August, but further moves are uncertain, according to Rachel Springall, from the financial information service Moneyfacts.\"Many will be waiting with bated breath for the Budget. This waiting game, alongside forecasts for inflation to remain above target, makes it less likely for the Bank of England to make further rate cuts this year,\" she said.She said that savers had seen a downward trend in returns during the time when the Bank has been lowering the Bank rate.\"The average easy access [savings] rate has fallen further below 3%, so savers must act now and switch their variable rate account if it no longer pays a decent return on their hard-earned cash,\" she said.Global pictureThe government would be keen to see interest rates fall further, to boost growth in the UK economy.The Resolution Foundation think-tank, which which focuses on those on low to middle incomes, said living standards needed to improve after a \"lost\" 20 years of growth.But ministers will be aware of the inflationary risk that remains in the UK, especially as prices are rising slower in countries such as the US, Germany, and France.Thursday's MPC decision will come after the US central bank chose to cut interest rates on Wednesday to a range of 4% to 4.25% for the first time since December.Last Thursday, the European Central Bank chose to hold its interest its at 2%.SavingsMoneyMonetary Policy Committee (MPC)Personal financeUK economyBank of EnglandMortgages",

Speaking after the High Court decision, Shabana Mahmood said \"last minute attempts to frustrate a removal are intolerable\". The man, who arrived in the UK by small boat last month, argued he was a victim of modern slavery in an appeal made just hours before his flight.Is the UK-France migrants returns deal workable?Migrant return flights to France set to start next weekIn the first High Court challenge to the \"one in, one out\" scheme, the Eritrean man's lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he may have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and that the decision to remove him had been rushed.The injunction raises questions about whether other migrants designated for deportation through the scheme could use similar grounds to delay or block their removal.A policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda put forward by the Conservatives under the last government became bogged down in repeated legal challenges before being cancelled by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer when he came into office.The Home Office is set to appeal against the decision and is reviewing the Modern Slavery Act to ensure it is not being misused.Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that the man could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims and would undermine the public interest in deterring deadly small boat crossings.Mahmood said: \"Migrants suddenly deciding that they are a modern slave on the eve of their removal, having never made such a claim before, make a mockery of our laws and this country's generosity.\"I will fight to end vexatious, last-minute claims. I will robustly defend the British public's priorities in any court. And I will do whatever it takes to secure our border.\"The deal with France was seen by the previous Home Secretary Yvette Cooper as one of her landmark policy achievements. It is now the job of her successor to make it work.Ministers agreed the \"one in, one out\" pilot deal with France in July to curb record small boat crossings this year.Under the deal, the UK will send asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for those who apply and are approved to come to Britain.France has reportedly said it will only accept a small initial contingent of deportations, while the UK has said it hopes to increase numbers over the course of the scheme.The latest setback follows reports that the first flights to France left empty on Monday and Tuesday. Despite this, the first removals of migrants to France under the pilot scheme are still expected to go ahead this week.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.Refugees and asylum seekersShabana MahmoodMigration",

Thick clouds of smoke can be seen as Israeli forces fire artillery shells and smoke bombs to cover their advance.The Sheikh Radwan district was home to tens of thousands of people before the war and is considered one of the city's most densely populated areas.Israel says the aim of its Gaza City offensive is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's \"last stronghold\" - but the operation has drawn widespread international condemnation.The leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that \"the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable\".Residents in Sheikh Radwan said Wednesday's incursion followed a wave of heavy airstrikes targeting buildings and main streets across the neighbourhood, in what appeared to be preparation for the ground assault.Saad Hamada, a local resident who fled south with his family earlier on Wednesday, told the BBC: \"The drones didn't leave anything. They hit solar panels, power generators, water tanks, even the internet network.\"Life became impossible, and that is what forced most people to leave despite the danger.\"ReutersThe incursion into Sheikh Radwan has triggered yet another wave of displacement, with thousands of families fleeing southSheikh Radwan includes the areas of Abu Iskandar, al-Tawam, and al-Saftawi, and is intersected by al-Jalaa Street, a vital artery linking central Gaza City with its northern districts.Locals say Israeli control of the neighbourhood could open the way for forces to advance deeper into the city and reach its central areas.The images of tanks in Gaza City's streets have caused widespread panic among residents, particularly those still living in the western and central parts of the city.Witnesses said the sight of tanks approaching their homes revived memories of previous incursions, that ended with entire neighbourhoods being flattened.The incursion into Sheikh Radwan has triggered yet another wave of displacement, with thousands of families fleeing south.Long lines of cars and carts loaded with belongings were seen on the roads, as the Israeli army opened a route to the south via the Salahedin Road. Residents reported journeys taking hours and costing hundreds of shekels due to the scarcity of transport and soaring prices.Getty ImagesThe Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood has already suffered massive damage in the warBefore the war, Sheikh Radwan was one of Gaza City's busiest districts, home to dozens of schools, mosques, and marketplaces.It had already been struck repeatedly by air raids in recent months, and there is widespread destruction, but the sight of tanks inside the area now marks a significant new phase in Israel's ground campaign.Israel launches ground offensive on Gaza CityThousands of Palestinians flee as Israeli troops push into Gaza CityThe frantic race to save historic treasures from Israeli bombsThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Wednesday morning that it had struck more than 150 targets across Gaza City in two days in support of its ground troops.As part of its operations, the IDF is also reportedly utilising old military vehicles loaded with explosives that have been modified to be controlled remotely. They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media.Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: \"Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn.\"\"Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night.\"Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the \"humanitarian area\" people are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it.Some who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents, so they returned north.\"Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction,\" Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. \"But where can we go? We have no refuge in the south.\"The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain.Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel \"categorically rejects the libellous rant\"Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,062 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.It said on Wednesday that 98 people had been killed and 385 injured by Israeli fire in the past 24 hours. Another four people had died from malnutrition, taking the total number of malnutrition-related deaths since a UN-backed body declared famine in Gaza City in late August to 154, it added.The UN has warned that an intensification of the offensive will push civilians into \"even deeper catastrophe\".On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

They had previously refused to rule out getting rid of education, health and care plans (EHCPs). In response to today's report, the Department for Education (DfE) says it is listening to families as it puts together plans to \"transform outcomes for every child with Send\". The Education Select Committee has spent the past eight months looking into how to achieve long-term sustainability for the Send system in England, and how to improve outcomes for children and young people.In their report today they made several recommendations to the DfE, including:Keeping EHCPs and Send tribunals as a \"backstop of accountability\" for parentsEstablishing new statutory national minimum standards for what support schools should offer on special educational needs at all levels of needMore Send training for all current and future mainstream school staff, including headteachersInvesting in more state specialist schoolsIncreasing per-pupil Send funding in line with inflationThe National Audit Office said last year that the Send system in England as a whole \"wasn't financially sustainable\" and was not delivering better outcomes for children and young people, despite big increases in high-needs funding over the last 10 years. The number of children and young people in England with an EHCP has increased to 638,745, the highest number since they were introduced a decade ago. An EHCP is a legal document outlining the support for special educational needs that a child or young person is entitled to.Nearly 1.3 million pupils are getting support for special educational needs in schools in England without an EHCP, but many parents value the legal rights to support that the plans set out and fight hard to get them put in place.Helen Hayes MP, chair of the Education Select Committee, said a \"root and branch\" reform of the Send system was needed and that \"a genuinely inclusive, well-resourced mainstream education system\" will bring costs down.\"The government must develop a standardised, national framework for the support that children with Send can expect in school, long before requiring an EHCP, so that there can be confidence and clear lines of accountability.\"Paul Whiteman, the general secretary for school leaders' union NAHT, agreed that all teachers should be trained in how to support children with special educational needs but said the responsibility shouldn't just lie with schools.\"There must be a collaborative multi-agency approach, with the onus not just on schools but on all health and child services to support children and young people with Send.\"There must be a recognition that funding for Send is currently insufficient and a re-thought system will need to be fully resourced in order to work.\"BBC/Kate McGoughTracy and her son Rowan, who has had an EHCP since he was five, joined a protest outside Parliament on Monday Tracy Winchester runs the parent campaign group SEND National Crisis in Worcestershire.She has been through three separate tribunals against her local authority to change the support in place for her son Rowan, who has had an EHCP since he was five.She's worried that the government might make changes to EHCPs in their upcoming reforms.\"We won't stand for our legal rights being taken away, and the thought of it is horrifying. It's not to say everything is perfect right now, but without the legal rights I don't know where we would have got to.\"Local authorities have to be careful with their budgets but, ultimately, this is our kids' education. If we haven't got that legal protection, where do we stand?\"A DfE spokesperson said: \"The report rightly highlights the need for actions we're already taking, to make sure that evidence-based support is available as routine, without a fight, for every child who needs it - from significant investment in places for children with Send, to improved teacher training, to our Best Start Family Hubs in every local area.\"UK governmentEngland",

Tiaras!State visits are as much about what everyone is wearing as they are about what they’re saying and doing.It is an exercise in fashion diplomacy - and there has been plenty of it on display as US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania visit the UK.From the First Lady's hat and striking yellow banquet dress, to the Princess of Wales's golden gown and historic tiara, here are some of the most eye-catching looks.Watch: Pomp, pageantry and protests as Trump gets the royal treatment in WindsorA striking yellow dressAt Wednesday night's formal state banquet, Melania went bold.Yellow. And a baby pink belt.The strapless floor length, long-sleeved dress by Carolina Herrera is nothing short of a statement.Gone was the hat, so for the first time on Wednesday, we saw her full face. She wore her hair down, and completed the look with sparkling, dangly earrings.Phil Noble/ReutersFor the state banquet, Donald Trump wore white tie, while Melania Trump opted for a yellow dress with a pink beltFor Marian Kwei, a celebrity stylist and Vogue contributor, Melania's gown was \"not the expected colour to see at a high state banquet\".\"Although it perhaps is in keeping with state dress protocol, the strapless gown is a little on the daring side,\" she said.It is not the first time we have seen Melania wear a strapless crepe gown for evening dress, however. She donned a similar design for her first dance following President Trump's inauguration in January.ReutersCamilla, the King, and Donald and Melania Trump showed off their banquet attireThe Queen, 78, attended the evening banquet wearing a royal blue, silk, marocain embroidered dress by Fiona Clare, a sapphire and diamond tiara, and the King's Family Order.King Charles's regalia was in keeping with the high pomp and pageantry that we would expect of a state banquet.He wore a formal tuxedo, looking \"every inch the monarch\", noted Kwei.The King, 76, completed his look with a royal blue sash - a colour that matched Camilla's dress.Meanwhile President Trump, 79, dressed the part for the evening's event in white tie.Timeless suit - and a statement hatAndrew Matthews/ReutersThe first lady's wide-brimmed purple hat covered much of her faceMelania, 55, is no stranger to impressive headwear - her white and navy wide-brimmed hat was a talking point at her husband's inauguration earlier this year. There was even an awkward moment when Trump tried to kiss her and the brim of her hat made it a tricky task. Cue the internet blowing up.The first lady went for a similarly dramatic flourish during the first official events on Wednesday. She arrived at Windsor Castle wearing a wide-brimmed purple hat that seemed to obscure her eyes, which she paired with a timeless, dark grey suit by Dior.PA MediaThe Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla chatted to First Lady Melania Trump as she arrived at Windsor Castle\"Melania's hat is not by chance,\" said Kwei.\"The hat with the wide brim that hides her face is pointing to a stance where she wants all eyes on her husband and his agenda while here,\" she added.ReutersMelania's hat stayed on inside, unlike the Queen who removed hersKwei noted that Melania’s hat matched the exact colour of Trump's tie, in \"a nod to her support for her husband's agenda during this state visit\".Dior is a favourite fashion house for Melania, and, for Kwei, her decision to wear it is a nod to America's support for Europe.Catherine's golden gownPhil Noble/ReutersThe Princess of Wales wore a couture gown by British designer Phillipa Lepley with a Lover's Knot tiaraFor the state banquet on Wednesday evening, the Princess of Wales wore a couture gown by British designer Phillipa Lepley with a full-length gold Chantilly lace evening coat.The coat featured hand-embroidered roses with couched gold cording, accented with French knots and satin-stitched blooms.The 43-year-old, who is sporting a new, blonder hairstyle, completed her look with the Lover's Knot Tiara.\"Formal state banquets are one of the rare occasions when royals wear tiaras,\" said Kwei. \"Kate is wearing her favourite tiara, which is no surprise. It was a favourite of Princess Diana, and originally belonged to Queen Mary.\"\"This is a really show-stopping dress and for me it really fits with the theme of this state visit being extra,\" royal expert Victoria Murphy added. She noted that gold isn't a colour we see Catherine wear a lot.\"But when she has worn it in the past, for example for [film] premieres, it has always been a real red-carpet moment,\" she said.The dress code for the state banquet was white tie, and the Prince of Wales, 43, did not disappoint.He was decked out in formal regalia and his orders, and wore an elegant Windsor tail coat.\"This is William at his most formal,\" said Murphy.She noted that on day-to-day engagements, the younger royals, in particular, can often be quite informal - but for an occasion like this, they pull out all the stops.\"The formality is all part of honouring the visiting guest,\" she said.A British classicOn Tuesday night, Melania stepped onto UK soil wearing the most British of fashion items: a Burberry trench coat.She wore the honey-coloured, floor-length coat with the collar turned up, while flashes of its signature lining were visible underneath.Melania completed the look with black sunglasses and boots.ReutersTrump and Melania held hands when they landed at London Stansted AirportVanessa Friedman, chief fashion critic at The New York Times, said that wearing a British-made coat could be an example of engaging in sartorial diplomacy, which is something many first ladies have done.For the Trumps' last state visit in 2019, Melania - a former model - also dressed in her British best, opting for brands such as Burberry, although she added a mix of European fashion houses too (think Celine and Dolce & Gabbana), as well as American designers including Michael Kors.It will be interesting to see how the choice of a British brand on this trip will be perceived back at home, says Kwei, given that Trump's message is about serving the interests of the United States before those of any other country.Melania Trump, enigmatic first lady who might do it differently this timeMatching in blue Getty ImagesThe King and Queen at the formal ceremonial welcomeThe Queen was seen during the day in a vibrant, sapphire blue dress, a matching coat by Fiona Clare and hat by Philip Treacy.She completed the look with a sapphire and diamond brooch.The Queen was matching with her husband, King Charles, who wore a blue suit and pale blue tie at the daytime events.A diplomatic message Getty ImagesThe Princess of Wales smiled as she greeted the US guestsThe Princess of Wales wore a burgundy Emilia Wickstead dress and a matching hat by Jane Taylor to greet the US president and first lady on Wednesday.From both the Queen and the Princess, it's a strong showing for British designers.Catherine completed her look with a feather brooch.Kwei noted it was interesting that, like the Trumps, the princess also chose to match her outfit to her husband William, who wore a burgundy tie.\"As with Melania, this is to show support and that she's at one with her spouse and home country's agenda,\" she said.\"Blue and red!,\" royal expert Murphy said of the outfit choices by the Queen and Catherine.\"This seems a clear example of coordinated diplomatic dressing to me, to reflect the US flag.\"It's an example of how the outfits can send a powerful diplomatic message.\"More on Trump's state visitLIVE: Follow the latest from Trump's state visit to UKWhat is the president doing during his visit?ANALYSIS: Focus on pageantry after Starmer's tough fortnightAmerica's unofficial party house where presidents stay in LondonWATCH: BBC correspondents on relationship between PM and presidentSecurity measures - from anti-dro...",

    "content": "What was on the menu and who was on guest list at state banquet?5 hours agoShareSaveSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentShareSaveWatch: Pomp, pageantry and protests as Trump gets the royal treatment in WindsorThe state banquet is the spectacular showstopper of a state visit, a glittering feast with speeches, royal toasts, trumpet fanfares and fancy food and wine. It's diplomacy served up with fine dining. A cut-glass shock-and-awe approach to hospitality designed to make a visiting leader like President Trump feel special.The setting in St George's Hall inside Windsor Castle is a remarkable sight, a mix of medieval banquet and Harry Potter film. Elaborately uniformed staff around the hall are as drilled as the soldiers who have been on parade during the day. The table settings, five glasses per person, are terrifyingly neat.For Trump's visit, the 160 guests, sitting behind 1,452 pieces of cutlery, were eating from a menu, written in French, which translates as:Hampshire Watercress Panna Cotta with Parmesan shortbread and quail egg saladOrganic Norfolk chicken ballotine wrapped in courgettes with a thyme and savoury infused jusVanilla ice cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior with lightly poached Victoria plumsGuests had a generous wine list.Wiston Estate, Cuvée, 2016Domaine Bonneau de Martray, Corton-Charlemagne, Grand Cru, 2018Ridge Vineyards, Monte Bello, 2000Pol Roger, Extra Cuvée de Réserve, 1998After-dinner drinks were drowning in symbolism. It's a 1945 vintage port, in honour of Trump having been the 45th US president, although he does not drink alcohol. There was a 1912 cognac, from the birth year of the president's Scottish-born mother.PA MediaWhat is the president doing during his visit?In pictures: Trump and Melania meet the royalsAmerica's unofficial party house where presidents stay in LondonMelania’s big hat, Kate’s feather brooch and other standout looksSecurity measures - from anti-drones and decoys to bringing in The BeastIf that doesn't seem enough there was a special cocktail, the Transatlantic Whisky Sour, which blends Johnnie Walker with the bright citrus of marmalade, with pecan foam and a toasted marshmallow on a biscuit.Rupert Murdoch and Tim CookPresident Trump's banquet in Windsor Castle was conspicuously missing celebrity faces or screen stars. Were there people in Hollywood, or even west London, who suddenly found they had to be somewhere else tonight?There's not even a hardy royal perennial like Sir David Beckham or Sir Elton John.Instead the guest list was heavy on political operators and tech bros. Apple boss Tim Cook was there, sitting next to the president's daughter, Tiffany Trump.Press baron Rupert Murdoch was sitting next to Sir Keir Starmer's key adviser Morgan McSweeney. The small talk must be interesting when Trump is suing the Murdoch press for billions in the US.Like at a wedding, guests must be checking the nameplates around the ornately-decorated table to see who they're sitting beside.The \"head\" of the table is in the middle for the Windsor state banquet, with the King and president in the centre of a dining table that is 47m long.President Trump, as the guest of honour, was placed between King Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales.The nameplate for Trump said \"President of the United States of America\", although in capital letters, oddly reminiscent of his social media messages.Facing them is the first lady, whose nameplate says \"Mrs Trump\", with Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales on either side of her.The seating arrangement threw up some interesting groupings. There was the US ambassador Warren Stephens flanked by Princess Anne on one side and Chancellor Rachel Reeves on the other.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was beside Stephen Schwarzman, mega-wealthy CEO of the Blackstone investment group. If Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch was searching for ideas, she was sitting next to Sam Altman, chief executive of the artificial intelligence firm, OpenAI.The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was there and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. Among UK politicians Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy were there.Golfer Nick Faldo and athlete Dame Katherine Grainger were among the more prominent sports stars at the banquet.Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, was one of the tech contingent.On the walls are royal portraits and suits of armour and the ceiling is studded with the coats of arms of Knights of the Garter.St George's Hall was rebuilt after the fire of 1992. So perhaps like many stories about the royals, it feels new and old at the same time.According to the travelling US press pack, the choice of music at the banquet reflected some of President Trump's favourites. Maybe they have their own messages to the politicians listening.It includes Nessun Dorma, meaning \"none shall sleep\" and You Can't Always Get What You Want.Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Trump and his wife Melania are staying with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, and will remain in the UK until Thursday night. The president was hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in June 2019.LIVE: Follow the latest on Trump's state visit to the UKChris Mason: Trump visit puts focus on pageantry after PM's tough fortnightWhat is a state visit? A state visit is a formal trip to the UK by the head of a country. They are usually arranged at the invitation of the monarch, acting on government advice.As well as being grand occasions with lots of pageantry, the visits are used by governments to further Britain's interests.Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term - such as Trump - are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as happened with former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush. However, in February Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed Trump an invitation from King Charles during a White House meeting to discuss a UK-US trade deal. Sir Keir said the invite was \"truly historic\" and \"unprecedented\".At the time, Trump said it was a \"great, great honour\".Trump loves all things royal. Will that be the King's ace card?Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfallsHow much will President Trump's visit cost the UK?What will Trump do during the state visit and where will he be?Getty ImagesTuesdayWhen they landed at Stansted Airport on Tuesday evening, the Trumps were met by US Ambassador Warren Stephens and Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. The Viscount Hood, Lord-in-Waiting, welcomed them on behalf of the King.Arriving in the UK, the president said: \"I have a lot of things here that warm my heart. I want to tell you. It's a very special place.\"The couple spent the night at the US ambassador's residence, Winfield House, in central London. WednesdayTrump and the first lady flew to Windsor by helicopter, and were greeted by the Prince and Princess of Wales.They were then formally welcomed by the King and Queen before joining them in a carriage procession through the Windsor estate. A royal salute was fired in Windsor and at the Tower of London, and the King invited Trump to inspect the guard of honour. After a private lunch with members of the Royal Family, the president visited St George's Chapel in Windsor and laid a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II.They watched a flypast by the Red Arrows, although the aerial display was scaled back because of poor weather so did not feature UK and US F-35 military jets as planned.Later on Wednesday evening, a traditional state banquet was held at the castle, attended by 160 guests including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and Apple boss Tim Cook.Trump spoke of the UK-US relationship, saying \"the word special does not begin to do it justice,\" while the King praised the US president for his \"personal commitment\" to finding solutions to world conflicts.How has Windsor prepared for Trump's visit?In pictures: Trump and Melania mingle with royalsMelania’s hat, Kate’s feather brooch and other standout looksThursday The president will travel to the prime minister's country house Chequers, in Buckinghamshire, for a meeting with Sir Keir. They will view the Sir Winston Churchill archives before holding a meeting and a press conference. Melania Trump will remain at Windsor Castle where she will tour the Royal Library and see Queen Mary's Dolls' House, a famous miniature palace built in the 1920s. She will also meet Chief Scout Dwayne Fields with Catherine, who is joint president of the Scout Association.Mrs Trump will then join her husband at Chequers before they return to the US.What vehicles and personnel has Trump brought to the UK?PA MediaDuring his July visit to Scotland, Trump's motorcade consisted of more than two dozen vehicles, flanked by police vehicles and ambulance crewsAccompanying Trump are US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy Steve Witkoff, chief of staff Susie Wiles and \"other senior White House staff\". Trump arrived in the UK on his customised, high-spec Boeing 747-200B aeroplane known as Air Force One.Once on the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - an enhanced limousine nicknamed \"The Beast\".Two identical versions of the presidential limousine - as well as several other Secret Service vehicles - are flown over to the UK in military cargo planes in advance of Trump's arrival.While Trump will make some short journeys by limousine in the UK, he is expected to do most of his travelling by air - as was the case during his trip to Scotland in July. The president will have brought a fleet of helicopters with him including Marine One which, like Air Force One, is not a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president.The president's security has been tightened in recent days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university in Utah.Donald Trump's UK visit: What’s he bringing with him?What protests have taken place during Trump's state visit?ReutersAn image of Donald Trump and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was projected on to the walls of Windsor Castle as the president arrived in the UKPolice arrested four people on suspicion of projecting images of Donald Trump and the late disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on to the walls of Windsor Castle.The footage appeared on Tuesday night as Trump touched down in the UK. There were some anti-Trump protesters among the crowds in Windsor on Wednesday. Thousands of people also gathered near the BBC's headquarters in London on Wednesday afternoon before marching towards Whitehall. Some carried banners reading: \"No to racism, no to Trump.\"Others had smaller versions of the 20ft Trump baby blimp balloon which was carried through crowds during protests against the US president's first state visit in 2019.PA MediaThe demonstration was organised by the Stop Trump UK coalition, a group of more than 50 campaign organisations, including climate, anti-racism and pro-Palestinian activists.It previously called on the government to cancel the state visit, accusing the US president of \"denying climate science\" and \"siding with war criminals - in Israel, Russia and beyond\".The group also organised protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh during Trump's recent Scotland visit, involving hundreds of people in the two cities.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he would boycott the ceremonial banquet for Trump to \"send a message\" over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Which other state visits has King Charles hosted?Getty ImagesFrench President Emmanuel Macron visited the UK in July Since King Charles succeeded Queen Elizabeth in September 2022, he has hosted state visits from a number of international leaders and royals:July 2025: French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte December 2024: Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and his wife Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al ThaniJune 2024: Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of JapanNovember 2023: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and his wife Kim Keon Hee.He and Queen Camilla have carried out state visits to France, Italy, Germany, Kenya and Samoa.

He said he's therefore \"excited\" to be returning at what feels like \"the perfect time\" because \"there's a lot of work to be done\".The first quarterly print edition of his new venture - titled 72 after the year he was born - focuses on the beauty of women over 50. It features Hollywood movie star and \"real human being\" Julia Roberts, 57, on its cover.Enninful came to London as an aslyum seeker, and after being appointed fashion director of the British fashion magazine i-D at the age of 18, he went on to become the first black editor-in-chief of British Vogue, where he championed diversity in order to \"represent the world we live in today.\"Fashion 'has to figure out what we stand for'Asked by Rajan if he thought a cultural \"anti-woke moment\" was now taking place, he agreed.\"I think it's definitely a cultural moment,\" he replied. \"Woke is a dirty word.\"We see what's happening in the world politically. So anything that's not deemed as normal or the norm is seen as wrong.\"The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines \"woke\" as meaning \"well-informed\" or \"up-to-date\" as well as being \"alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice\".It has been seen as a badge of honour by some on the left, but more often as an insult by those on the right.The fashionista continued: \"It's not woke to think that someone curvy is beautiful, it's not woke to think someone from another country is beautiful.\"He believes the fashion industry \"has to figure out where we stand and what we stand for\".Getty ImagesEdward Enninful and Anna Wintour pictured at 2024's UK premiere of Disney+ documentary series, In Vogue: The 1990sIn the same interview, Enninful spoke about his departure from Vogue and his relationship with Dame Anna Wintour, who is stepping back as editor-in-chief of American Vogue after 37 years.He laughed at widespread reports the two had fallen out and that he had been forced out.\"When I took the job, I gave myself five years and I did six,\" he explained, adding that she had asked him to give them a year's notice so they could find his replacement, who turned out to be Chioma Nnadi.\"So it was my decision to leave. But I just loved all these stories like, oh my God, Anna and I were fighting!\"He said she was \"actually very supportive\" because she could see he was leaving \"a secure place\" like Vogue to go it alone.\"Anna and I, we text each other all the time. You're going to see us together.\"Enninful also gave his views on the controversial recent Sydney Sweeney jeans advert.US fashion retailer American Eagle had the Euphoria and White Lotus actress resplendent in its denim alongside the words: \"Syndey Sweeney has great jeans.\"Some people took the gene pun to mean the ad was implying a racially superior ideal of beauty. Others, however, backed Sweeney and described the outrage as overblown.\"I thought people really read into it probably deeper than I would have,\" said Enninful, noting how Sweeney is currently \"having a great moment\" in her career.\"But then also on the other hand, I guess if you have a blonde woman sitting there talking about her jeans, it will trigger some people.\"So I feel like the population is quite divided really, isn't it?\"All episodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are available to listen to on BBC Sounds.Is super skinny back?

The Daily Express is dominated by a full-page photo of President Trump and First Lady Melania grinning next to the King and Queen at the state banquet. \"My respect for you and Britain\" reads the headline of its only front page story.The Sun mirrors The Express with a full-page spread of the same shot, captioning it \"the special bond\" as the \"prez hails UK at banquet... and band plays 007\".The Guardian also leads with the state visit, writing \"PM banks on £150bn investment to placate critics of Trump visit\". A poem to mark the occasion by the former Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy accompanies the piece.The Times leads with \"We are kin, King tells Trump\", adding that the president was \"delighted by pomp\". And in immigration news, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood \"demands slavery law review after deportations blocked\". The paper says she blamed \"vexatious last-minute claims\" for the failure to remove any migrants to France this week.The Daily Telegraph also features the image of the royals with their American guests, but leads with the news that the \"one in, one out\" deal has been \"blocked by Home Office-backed charity\". The paper says Bail for Immigration Detainees has produced a \"legal guide to avoid deportation\". A spokesperson for the charity denied it was helping people \"beat the system\" and said it provides legal advice.It is \"day two of Starmer's delicious humiliation on human rights\" reads the front page the Daily Mail as the \"Home Secretary blasts lefty lawyers!\" An image of Catherine, Princess of Wales also makes the Mail's front page who \"glitters in a gold lace gown\" as the tabloid promises the \"inside story from day Trump got the royal treatment\".The i Paper dubs the monarch the \"diplomat King\" as it says he \"urges Trump to stand up to Putin tyranny\".

He denies any involvement.The Mirror leads on the story of the \"Maddie suspect freed\" with a picture of Brückner smoking as he's \"back on the streets\". The \"rapist enjoys crisps and burger after his release\", it writes.President Trump's State Visit to the UK features prominently with many papers publishing photos of him and his wife, First Lady Melania, dressed for Wednesday's banquet at Windsor Castle. The Times focuses on the King's praise for the special relationship between the US and Britain, calling the two countries 'the closest of kin'. The Daily Express quotes Trump as thanking the King with the headline \"my respect for you and Britain\".The Guardian highlights the government's announcement that £150bn of US money is to be invested in the UK. The paper suggests Sir Keir Starmer is banking on the investments to placate critics of President Trump's visit.The Daily Mail says the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has \"blasted\" migrants who lodge last minute legal challenges against deportation, accusing them of \"making a mockery of our laws\".

    "title": "A court blocked a migrant being returned to France - how much of a setback is this for No 10?",
    "content": "Is the UK-France migrants returns deal workable?17 hours agoShareSaveHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondent andDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentShareSavePA MediaJust one stumbling block for one migrant? Or something much more serious which threatens the government's approach to small boats?Those are the questions being posed in government now after a 25-year-old Eritrean man managed to block the government from putting him on a flight to France at the High Court on Tuesday.It is just a temporary decision. The judge granted a pause of at least 14 days so the man, who is not being named for legal reasons and arrived in the UK on a small boat last month, could provide evidence of his claim that he has been a victim of modern day slavery.But it is certainly frustrating for a government which had hoped that the removal flights to France under the 'one in, one out' scheme would begin this week. They may still do so. Either way, the steady drumbeat of people being put on flights through the week appears not to have materialised.The stumbling blocks with Tuesday's case show how complicated quick turn-around deportation or removal plans can be.And in this case, they concern the UK's laws on modern day slavery and trafficking - and the way the Home Office handles these cases.After the man arrived on a small boat in August, officials swiftly rejected his case and told him he could and should have claimed asylum in France.But he also asked for protection as a victim of modern day slavery, saying he has suffered harm in Libya, long before he came to the UK.There was no evidence he was trafficked across the Channel, not least because his mother had paid smugglers about £1,000 to take him.Now, here's the important twist.The Home Office's trafficking assessors - different officials to the team organising removal flights - said the Eritrean man's story was weak.But that rejection was not their final decision. The UK's rules allow a rejected applicant to ask for a reconsideration.The senior judge dealing with the case repeatedly asked the man's lawyers why he could not make those representations from France, including gathering any medical evidence.It looked and sounded like the Home Office was going to win. But then, as the courtroom battle dragged on, the department's own trafficking officials effectively confirmed that they would not expect the man to do that.That fatally undermined any hope the home secretary had of getting this 25-year-old on the 9am flight from London Heathrow.If the Home Office wasn't such a secure bomb-proof building, we might have been able to hear howls from its ministerial corridors echo around the Royal Courts of Justice, two miles away.So where does this decision leave the project?This single decision does not kill the France returns plan, but it's symptomatic of a decades-long criticism, that the Home Office regularly snatches defeat from the jaws of victory thanks to epic levels of dysfunction.Yes, the government never committed publicly to flights in the air this week. But in private, there was a strong expectation from those around Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, of a string of departures this week.But immigration is complicated - really complicated - and the awkwardness of Tuesday's injunction aside, officials know other English Channel crossers may mount similar arguments.The government's own KC argued in court that if the judge blocked this removal, as he went on to do, then \"the deterrent effect of this policy will be undermined\".Eritrean man wins block on removal to France under 'one in, one out' dealMigrant return flights to France set to start next weekHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?Anyone who presents a reasonable argument that they might have been a victim of trafficking is entitled to at least 45 days to \"recover and reflect\" - with a final decision on their case maybe a year down the road. If this claimant gets that positive decision, he could be off the removal list for a year on top of that as he waits a final outcome.The political risk for the government is that their own lawyer is now proved right, not least because so many arriving on small boats have travelled through countries like Libya where trafficking and abuse are rife.It is too soon to say conclusively whether Tuesday's interim judgment means that this scheme will get bogged down in repeated legal action like the Conservatives' proposed Rwanda policy, which never got off the ground before being cancelled by Sir Keir Starmer 14 months ago when he entered office.The Conservatives, though, see vindication in the development. Their leader, Kemi Badenoch, told LBC that her message for the government was: \"We told you so.\"Science Secretary Liz Kendall told BBC Breakfast that scheme was not intended as a \"silver bullet\" and this single ruling would \"not stop this really important deal from going ahead\".The deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements, it is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work.Mahmood is seen at the government as a punchier communicator - displayed, perhaps, in her opening vow as home secretary to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration.Her colleagues will be hoping she is not having to deploy those communication skills at the end of the week to explain why no-one has been flown to France yet.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.Home OfficeUK governmentMigration",

    "content": "Blue Badge fraud: 'More fakes than ever before'2 hours agoShareSaveGeorgia PonciaSouth East Investigations Team andAlex BishSouth East Investigations TeamShareSaveThe BBC has been out with enforcement officers as they patrol the streets trying to catch drivers who are using Blue Badges illegallyBlue Badges are being faked, doctored, stolen and sold online, fraud investigators are warning. They are also finding people using badges belonging to family members without them present, and even badges of those who have died - which is illegal.Paul Slowey, from the Blue Badge Fraud Investigation (BBFI) agency, says he is confiscating \"more fake badges than ever before\", and that the Blue Badge scheme is being \"thoroughly abused\" by those wanting to get free parking that they are not entitled to. The government says it has strengthened powers by enabling plain clothes officers to inspect Blue Badges and confiscate those being used misused.The Blue Badge scheme gives disabled people access to specially adapted designated bays. Badge holders are allowed to park for free in on-street pay-and-display bays and for up to three hours on yellow lines - except where there are loading restrictions.They are also exempt from paying the London Congestion Charge which costs £15 / day. Parking can come at a premium, with on-street bays costing as much as £5.90 per hour in some parts of the south-east England.This makes the badges desirable to thieves and fraudsters, who sell them on. Paul Slowey helps local councils to investigate fraudulent use of Blue BadgesThe BBFI agency, a community interest company run by Mr Slowey from Hampshire, helps local councils check drivers are using Blue Badges correctly. Fake and stolen badges are being sold online for hundreds of pounds He says he is confiscating \"more fake badges than ever before\", and that the Blue Badge system is being \"thoroughly abused\".Mr Slowey is calling for more enforcement to help check and seize badges, which he hopes will lead to prosecutions. Steve SwyerSteve Swyer describes his car, and a place to park it, as a lifelineThe use of fake badges, taking up the already limited number of disabled bays, has a knock-on effect.Steve Swyer, who lives in rural Surrey. has a Blue Badge because he has multiple sclerosis (MS). He uses a wheelchair so he needs to park somewhere level and with a dropped curb and which is close to his destination. He says disabled bays cater to these needs, but often cars are parked in the bays with no Blue Badge displayed. Stolen, faked or dead: How the Blue Badge is being abused\"It used to make me quite angry but I've got so used to it now. It's just become a part of normal life for me - to pull up and realise you can't get where you need to go,\" Mr Swyer said.\"If I didn't have the car I'd spend probably 90% of my time indoors, literally not seeing anybody or going anywhere.\"He says he is always fearful someone might break into his car to steal his Blue Badge. \"You're advertising something that's very valuable - it makes you a target.\"Mark Jobling says family members and carers must not use a Blue Badge without having the disabled person in the car with themEast Sussex County Council is one of the local authorities now checking for Blue Badge abuse. Mark Jobling, an investigations officer in the council's Blue Badge team, says one-in-five badges is being misused. He says he mostly deals with disabled people's family members using the badge without the badge holder present, but also has had cases of people using a deceased relative's badge. Erika North has a hidden disability. She says she is often challenged about parking in disabled bays, despite showing her Blue BadgeErika North from Kent works for BBC Children in Need. She also has multiple sclerosis. Disabled bays near where she lives \"are so in demand, often by 10am the few areas that have disabled bays are already full up,\" she says. \"My Blue Badge enables me to carry on as I normally should be able to do for as long as possible. \"It's not some sort of perk\". Parking in a disabled bay without displaying a valid Blue Badge can result in a fine. Blue Badge misuse - such as using someone else's permit - comes with harsher penalties. It is a classed as fraud and is punishable by an unlimited fine or up to two years in prison. A new scheme to crackdown on Blue Badge misuse was launched in Brighton and Hove in December.'Competing priorities'The charity Disabled Motoring UK is calling for local authorities to be given more resources for enforcement.The Local Government Association says councils will do what they can, but they have to take into account a number of competing priorities when using their limited resources to take enforcement action against blue badge fraud.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"Exploitation of the Blue Badge scheme is completely unacceptable – it is a vital resource helping many people travel with confidence.It says it is \"supporting the police to tackle this issue by working closely with local authorities\". It says it has strengthened the powers to help local authorities tackle fraud and misuse, and given them the ability to cancel stolen badges.Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

His rhetoric was bold, his deeds less so. Now, however, by sending the Israeli military into Gaza City, he appears to have dispensed with constraints.The operation, which he says is necessary to defeat Hamas but is certain to increase Israel’s isolation as international anger mounts, has already killed many Palestinians and sent hundreds of thousands into flight southward. It risks the lives of the estimated 20 living Israeli hostages. It renders any cease-fire unimaginable for the moment. It has been questioned even by the military’s chief of staff.To all this, Mr. Netanyahu’s response seems to be: Bring it on.This week, he suggested that Israel should become a “super Sparta,” apparently meaning that the ancient Greek city-state that rose through discipline to become a great military power should inspire the country. Speaking at an economic conference hosted by the Finance Ministry, he said Israel might have to confront “isolation” through “autarky,” or economic self-sufficiency.“He’s lost it,” Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, said. “There are no more red lines.”Vilified by the hostages’ anguished families, confronted by large street protests, fiercely criticized by alienated European allies for the bombardment of Gaza that has taken tens of thousands of Palestinian lives, Mr. Netanyahu only becomes more defiant.ImageProtesting in “Hostage Square,” in Tel Aviv, last week.Credit...Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThis month he vowed that “there will be no Palestinian state.” Even if preventing one has been the primary focus of his political life, he has become much more explicit of late. The remark amounted to a rebuke to states including France, Britain, Canada and Australia that have said they will recognize a state of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly beginning next week.It would be foolhardy, however, to equate Mr. Netanyahu’s increasingly headstrong braggadocio with imminent downfall.He has not amassed a total of almost 18 years as prime minister and become the nation’s longest-serving leader without proving himself a shrewd, adaptable and ruthless leader. “Only Bibi!” goes the chant of his hard-core supporters, using his nickname.To them he is the irreplaceable “King,” the one man with the mettle to face down Israel’s enemies on seven fronts. His decapitation of Hezbollah in Lebanon and undermining of Iran’s nuclear ambitions through a brief war have led to talk in the region of an imperial Israel.Perhaps his weakest enemy has proved his toughest. He appears to believe that he can force Hamas to surrender or disappear through military might alone, but has been obliged to redefine his approach again and again.To his opponents, who chant “Anything but Bibi,” Mr. Netanyahu is simply the face of the desecration of Israeli democracy.At this tense juncture in Israel’s history, Mr. Netanyahu has one clear advantage: the largely uncritical support of President Trump. A world drifting under Mr. Trump’s impulsion in an authoritarian direction had helped birth a Bibi unbound. He is emboldened because, as never before, he is confident that, no matter what, this America will have his back.ImageIsraeli soldiers standing next to armored personnel carriers near the border with Gaza on Tuesday.Credit...Amir Cohen/Reuters“Trump is the only person on earth who can dictate to Bibi what he should do,” Ehud Olmert, a former prime minister and strong critic of Mr. Netanyahu, told me. “He has the power to save thousands of lives.”It is unclear, however, whether Mr. Trump would ever confront Mr. Netanyahu in this way.“Netanyahu is a real leader, there are not many leaders of his stature in history,” said Daniella Weiss, a prominent leader of the settler movement that has drawn strength and limitless license to expand its West Bank settlements from the devastating Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people.For all his nationalist and religious support, Mr. Netanyahu is widely loathed. He is suspected by many of putting his own survival before the interests of the nation by prolonging a Gaza war that his critics say should have ended long ago.Liberal Israel, unbowed despite a rightist tide, perceives him as shredding the fundamental values of the state and the core of Jewish ethics through the prosecution of a relentless military campaign that continues to kill Palestinian civilians in large numbers without setting an attainable objective. Israeli hostages have languished in tunnels for more than 700 days.“What Netanyahu is doing now in Gaza is outrageously brutal,” Mr. Olmert said. “How can ministers at the highest level say all Gazans are Hamas and then herd them into camps? We are in a fight for the soul of Israel.”A Channel 12 poll this month showed Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party leading in any election with 24 seats, but indicated that the parties in his far-right government would fall well short of enough seats in the 120-member Knesset to renew the coalition. Still, with elections more than a year away, Mr. Netanyahu’s political options are far from exhausted.During a two-day visit this week by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, there was not a hint of American criticism, even after Israel’s recent attempted assassination of Hamas leaders in Qatar, an important American ally. Mr. Rubio said the United States was not counting on a deal with Hamas, “a terrorist group, a barbaric group, whose stated mission is the destruction of the Jewish state.”ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem on Sunday.Credit...Pool photo by Nathan HowardMr. Trump appears to want the war in Gaza ended at once, with all the hostages, living or dead, released and Hamas defeated, whatever precisely that means. Whether Mr. Trump seeks a two-state peace, the position of most past American governments over decades, is unclear, but most of his pronouncements suggest not.Because the president’s statements on the war are unpredictable and marked by impatience, but always rooted in unswerving support for Israel, Mr. Netanyahu is left with much room for maneuver.Two months ago, Mr. Netanyahu seemed to be seriously contemplating a possible deal with Hamas that would have seen 10 living Israeli hostages released in exchange for a large number of Palestinian prisoners and a 60-day cease-fire during which an end to the war would have been negotiated.Then he went to Washington, met Mr. Trump, changed his mind, and began planning the assault on Gaza City with its accompanying prolongation of the war and intensification of Palestinian agony in Gaza.It looked like a choice driven by his survival instincts. The end of the war holds many dangers for Mr. Netanyahu. They include the breakup of his coalition as rightist ministers object; a commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 debacle; a full accounting of Israel’s actions during the war; and an end to protection from his own legal travails.An Israel at war, an Israel in what he presents as manifest existential danger, suits Mr. Netanyahu better. It plays to his tactical strengths. In the end, at least in the view of the hostages’ families and their many outraged supporters, his own survival trumps that of the hostages.“My Matan is being sacrificed on Netanyahu’s altar,” Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, a hostage, said on Tuesday.Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right minister of national security, made clear on social media this week that he strongly approved of Mr. Netanyahu’s decision to move into Gaza City. “The decisive moment has come,” he...",

    "title": "U.K. State Visit Updates: King Charles Emphasizes Historic Ties With U.S. at State Dinner",
    "content": "PinnedShawn McCreesh and Maggie HabermanReporting from Windsor and LondonHere’s the latest.President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, attended a lavish state dinner at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, where they were warmly received by the British royal family on the first day of an official visit heavy with pomp and grandeur.King Charles III welcomed President Trump to the banquet, saying the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom “has made us safer and stronger through the generations.”“Our people have fought and died together for the values we hold dear,” he added.For his part, Mr. Trump commended Charles for his environmentalism and his work “uplifting the poor.” He said being invited for a second state visit to the United Kingdom was one of the “highest honors” of his life. He also extolled about the “special relationship” between Britain and America, saying the word special “does not begin to do it justice.”With 160 guests attending, the banquet table was lined with power brokers from the worlds of technology, finance, media and government. White House aides were mixed in up and down the table with various lords and ladies of the English gentry.Earlier the president laid a wreath at Queen Elizabeth II’s tomb and watched a ceremony involving several military marching bands in full dress uniform on the East Lawn of the castle, while the Red Arrows, a Royal Air Force acrobatic team, flew over leaving red, white and blue contrails across the sky.The state visit is part of an effort by the British government to engage with a president who has returned to office less interested than ever in maintaining the post-World War II order and possibly divert him on key issues affecting the two nations. The fact that Mr. Trump has been invited to Britain for a second state visit — after his first in 2019 — is itself a rare diplomatic gesture that no other American president has enjoyed.In contrast to his red carpet reception from royalty and political leaders, thousands of demonstrators gathered in central London to protest the visit by Mr. Trump, who is unpopular in Britain, according to opinion polls. Some held placards reading “Dump Trump,” “Trump for Prison,” and “No to racism, No to Trump.”Here’s what else to know:Two-day visit: Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to sign a handful of deals on Thursday, and to hold a joint news conference. The Trumps plan to spend the night at Windsor Castle.U.K. upheaval: Over the weekend, the anti-immigrant agitator Tommy Robinson led a protest of more than 100,000 people through London — one of the largest far-right demonstrations in Britain’s history. Mr. Trump’s former adviser, Elon Musk, who has repeatedly amplified Mr. Robinson on social media, delivered a virtual address to the demonstrators in which he called for a change in government and used alarmist rhetoric about immigration, telling Britons: “Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you.” Mr. Starmer condemned the remarks.Epstein ties: Though Mr. Trump might have hoped to leave behind the political tensions at home, British activists protested his arrival on Tuesday by projecting a picture of the president with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the walls of Windsor Castle and unrolling a massive banner of the picture on the castle’s lawn. Last week, Mr. Starmer fired his ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, over his ties to Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Starmer were expected to face questions about the Epstein saga.Show moreSept. 17, 2025, 6:03 p.m. ETShawn McCreeshReporting from LondonHere’s who attended the state dinner at Windsor Castle.The banquet table was lined with power brokers from the worlds of technology, finance, sports and media, as well as government.

Wednesday night’s state dinner was particularly lavish. Hosted in Windsor Castle’s St. George’s Hall, the white-tie event saw Mr. Trump and several members of his administration mingling with British royalty and business leaders alike.On one side of the hall’s grand banquet table — 155 feet long — place settings were arranged for Secretary of State Marco Rubio, King Charles III, Mr. Trump, and Catherine, the princess of Wales. On the other side: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Queen Camilla, Melania Trump and Prince William.Just over 100 staff members served a total of 160 guests. Among them were Prime Minister Keir Starmer; Rupert Murdoch of News Corp; Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple; and the Open AI chief executive, Sam Altman.The menu began with a Hampshire watercress panna cotta, served with parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad. The main course was an organic Norfolk chicken ballotine wrapped in courgettes, with a thyme and savory-infused jus. For dessert, guests were to be served a vanilla ice cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior and lightly poached Victoria plums.Though Mr. Trump is a teetotaler, the dinner featured a lush wine list as well as a 1945 vintage port, to honor his first term as the 45th American president, and a 1912 cognac Grande Champagne, to note his mother’s birth year. There’s also an elaborate cocktail invented for the dinner — a “Transatlantic Whisky Sour” that blended Johnnie Walker Black scotch with marmalade and was topped with a pecan foam and a toasted marshmallow on a star-shaped biscuit.Show moreSept. 17, 2025, 4:58 p.m. ETThe New York TimesHere’s the menu for the state dinner at Windsor Castle.ImageKing Charles III’s place setting at the banquet table in St George’s Hall at Windsor Castle on Wed...",

It is now a crime scene, all but destroyed within a few hours of fiery frenzy on Sept. 9. Workers emerged from the wreckage of the prime minister’s office on Monday heaving salvaged documents on their shoulders. Other papers fluttered through the air. A dog stopped to urinate on a pile of demographic reports.“We don’t know anything, it’s a mess,” said Pashupati Mahat, an under secretary of the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation. The ministry’s entire legal department had gone up in flames.ImageWorkers moving salvaged files from the prime minister’s office to a new office in the Singha Durbar complex in Kathmandu.VideoDamage inside the Singha Durbar in Kathmandu.CreditCredit...Down a blackened hallway, past a staircase that ended midstep between the second and third floors, the education minister’s office was dark with soot, one wall punched out by fire. Pens and paper clips sat on the minister’s desk, along with two phones with no dial tone.Outside each ministry, parking lots had transformed into cemeteries of seared cars and motorcycles. The government now has almost no official vehicles on hand. A computer motherboard was wedged between rhododendron bushes.A singed office chair had somehow rolled into the middle of the road, taking on a strangely permanent position.Nestled in the Himalayas, Nepal has suffered from earthquakes and endured a decade of civil war. But this arson spree ripped the heart out of the country’s government in a single afternoon. The destruction was as if the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court and almost every graceful government building in Washington was ransacked, and nearly every state capital, too.The protests began with peaceful students angry about official corruption and a widening wealth gap. Then mobs unleashed their attacks. The scale of the damage leaves Nepal’s new caretaker government, installed in the wake of the protests and a deadly crackdown by security forces, even more vulnerable.ImageA burned hallway in the office of Nepal’s prime minister.

The handful of ministers that she has named so far have no working ministries. On Monday, after their swearing in, they posed outside in chairs placed in front of the rubble.“All the institutions responsible for running the country and documents were destroyed,” Ms. Karki said on Sunday, after her own oath taking. “We are in a zero state.”After Parliament was burned, mobs stormed the Singha Durbar, or the Lion’s Palace, with its Italian glass chandeliers, intricate woodwork and marble staircases. They anointed its splendor with gallons of fuel.They lit up grand ministries: education, home, health, transport, energy, among others. They set ablaze the Supreme Court, destroying 60,000 case files, according to one estimate. The Special Court, which handles corruption cases, was not spared, complicating any future efforts to combat graft.

    "title": "As Trump Arrives, Europe’s Right Claims Charlie Kirk as One of Their Own",
    "content": "SKIP For all the many languages spoken at an international convention of far-right parties this weekend in Madrid, Charlie Kirk was the one name on all their lips.“This is mobilizing,” said André Ventura, the leader of Portugal’s surging far-right party, Chega, after he had fired up the Madrid crowd with outrage over the killing of Mr. Kirk, a popular organizer of conservative youth who was assassinated in Utah last week.“Usually, the leftists look at a tragedy and say, ‘OK, this guy is a hero, let’s make him a hero.’ But now the right wing and the conservatives are doing the same,” Mr. Ventura said. Right-wing leaders, he added, “should pray for Charlie Kirk, for his family, but we should also not forget his name and use him.”President Trump is arriving in Europe against a backdrop of conservative fervor, as the continent’s hard-right parties seize on Mr. Kirk’s death as a rallying point. After decades of claiming victimization in their own countries, Europe’s right wing is on an upswing. They are winning elections, gaining traction among young voters and enjoying the support of Mr. Trump, who landed in Britain on Tuesday for a state visit.And talking about Mr. Kirk’s assassination, experts said, fits neatly into their pre-existing, and often embroidered, narratives of persecution and exclusion.“There is a common narrative across the far right of victimization, and this is one of the reasons this is so attractive to latch on to,” said Marta Lorimer, a politics lecturer at Cardiff University and an expert on the far right in Europe. “It says, ‘Look, not only have we been excluded, but now we’re also being murdered.’”On Sunday, Santiago Abascal, leader of Vox, Spain’s increasingly popular far-right party that hosted the event, declared “the assassination of Charlie was not an isolated case,” adding, “We know they don’t kill us because we are fascists, they call us fascists so they can kill us.”Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister and a hero to Europe’s right, began her video address to the convention by paying “homage to Charlie Kirk,” a reminder, she said, of “on which side there is violence and intolerance.”ImagePrime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy paid homage to Mr. Kirk in a recent address.Credit...Filippo Attili/Palazzo Chigi, via LaPresse, via Associated PressTom Van Grieken, head of a secessionist Flemish party from Belgium, told the crowd that the right wing would win over Europe with ideas, not as the left did “with bullets like they did with Charlie Kirk.”The message about Mr. Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, resonated around the European far-right echo chamber.Right-wing members of the European Parliament banged on desks when denied a moment of silence for him in Strasbourg, France, something they said George Floyd, the Black man killed by police in Minnesota, had received. “Because Black lives matter, as is well known,” Afroditi Latinopoulou, the leader of Greece’s Voice of Reason party, said in Madrid, “but not the lives of whites. Enough is enough.”In London on Saturday, more than 100,000 demonstrators marched in a rally organized by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, during which they listened to a young French activist attribute his attendance as an “homage to Charlie Kirk.” Elon Musk, who connected by video feed, called the left “the party of murder” and urged protesters to “fight back” or “die.”For decades, Europe shunned its far-right parties and created cordons sanitaires to keep them out of power. That era is over. Hard-line positions against immigration have increasingly gone mainstream. So have hard-right leaders. Ms. Meloni, the first politician steeped in neo-fascism to run a major European nation, is seen as a trailblazer.More traditional conservative parties, desperate to stay relevant, have sought alliances with such groups, stirring debates about whether they are legitimizing or normalizing extremists. In France and Germany, support for once taboo parties continues to build, with encouragement from the United States under Mr. Trump.ImageProtesters in London held up a picture of Mr. Kirk on Saturday during a rally organized by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson.Credit...Jaimi Joy/ReutersSpeaking in Munich in February, Vice President JD Vance implicitly defended Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany. “There is no room for firewalls,” he said. Mr. Musk was more explicit, posting, “Only the AfD can save Germany.” The transformation of Mr. Kirk into a sort of Che Guevara figure for the right marked a new phase.The European far right for decades has sustained itself in the political cold with a culture of martyrdom. Spanish conservatives pointed to political prisoners and Catholics murdered by Communists during the Spanish Civil War. More recently, Mr. Abascal used Mr. Kirk’s death to evoke decades of terrorism by a separatist movement that targeted nationalists among others. In Italy, Ms. Meloni was brought up to revere the fascists killed by partisans and dumped into northern Italian sinkholes, and also hard-right militants killed by leftist extremists during the street battles and domestic terrorism of the 1970s.As motivating as those stories, and others, of persecution were to marginalized nationalist groups, they rarely resonated across borders. And efforts to turn the past decade’s anti-establishment wave into an international movement have faltered. After getting kicked out of the White House in 2017, the American populist Steve Bannon flew around Europe trying to sign up right-wing leaders for an ill-fated venture called “The Movement.”Mr. Bannon “was for his own glory,” said Hermann Tertsch, a member of the European Parliament with Vox. The mobilization around Mr. Kirk was different, he added, because the influencer resonated with a booming, more online population of young conservatives. Mr. Tertsch said Mr. Kirk was someone leaders sought out at conservative conventions in the United States.Mr. Ventura, of Chega, added that the assassination, caught on camera and instantly shared in a global “image culture,” helped explain why Mr. Kirk had become such a potent symbol. Also, he said, “maybe because it happened in the United States.”ImageA makeshift memorial for Mr. Kirk last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.Credit...Annegret Hilse/ReutersYoung nationalists around Europe have repeatedly said that the United States under Mr. Trump has surpassed the Old World in populism and emerged as the global influencer. Now, in Mr. Kirk, whose views on immigration, women and Islam made him abhorrent to some liberals, they have a global martyr.“He was a model,” said César Enrique Pintado Planell, 29, a former spokesman for La Revuelta, or the Revolt, a youth organization closely aligned with Vox.He said he admired the way Mr. Kirk went to university campuses, something the far right in Spain was “still in their first steps of doing.” He cited the last social media post by Mr. Kirk, in which the American conservative urged the politicization of the killing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte, N.C., light rail train. “This is similar,” Mr. Planell said. “If we don’t speak about what happened to Charlie, nothing will change.”At a booth selling “Make Spain Great Again” caps, Rocío López Belmonte, 28, said she was shocked by the assassination and had spread Kirk’s posts, which were translated into Spanish. Asked if Spain had a similar figure, she pointed at David Santos, 41, selling the hats behind her. “He’s a YouTuber,” she said. “He’s famous.”Mr. Santos has only a small fraction of Mr. Kirk’s followers but said he hoped to follow in his footsteps. He said that, like Mr. Kirk, he had been “insulted, threatened,” especially after streaming anti-establishment views from a Spanish town where hard-right groups, egged on by Vox, pursued migrants after the beating there of an older man.Now, he said, it was Mr. Kirk’s assassination that had struck a nerve with the hard ...",

    "title": "President Trump’s State Visit to the UK: What to Know",
    "content": "SKIP President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, arrived in Britain on Tuesday night for a two-day state visit, hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla.Here’s what you need to know:What is a state visit?How often do state visits happen in Britain?Wasn’t President Trump in Britain recently? And has he made a state visit before?What is on the agenda?Are protests planned?Are state visits purely ceremonial, or are they political, too?What is a state visit?In Britain, state visits are hosted by the monarch, and are a moment when the country rolls out the red carpet for visiting foreign royalty, presidents or prime ministers, showcasing the pomp, pageantry and ceremony for which the country is known.Designed to strengthen Britain’s ties with other nations, the program usually includes a glittering banquet in a royal palace and a procession in a horse-drawn carriage.State visits are arranged at the invitation of the sovereign, acting on government advice. They do not take place between Britain and the 14 countries, including Australia and Canada, that are members of the Commonwealth and share the king as head of state.Mr. Trump and the first lady can expect all the finery and flourishes of a stay with the royal family. The carriage procession through the Windsor estate will be escorted by mounted soldiers from the Household Cavalry. At a white-tie state banquet on Wednesday evening, attended by around 150 guests, the king will make a speech and propose a toast to the president, who will reply and propose a toast in return.How often do state visits happen in Britain?Typically, one or two take place each year, with King Charles III undertaking a similar number to other countries.ImageThe most recent foreign leader to receive a state visit in Britain was President Emmanuel Macron of France in July.Credit...Pool photo by Ludovic MarinQueen Elizabeth II hosted around 112 state visits in Britain between her accession in 1952 and her death in 2022 and made 89 outbound state visits between 1955 and 2015.The most recent foreign leader to receive the honor in Britain was President Emmanuel Macron of France in July.Wasn’t President Trump in Britain recently? And has he made a state visit before?Yes, and yes. In July, Mr. Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland, opened a new golf course in Aberdeenshire. While the trip was officially a vacation, the president held talks with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain.In 2019, during his first presidency, Mr. Trump was hosted for a state visit by Queen Elizabeth II. A second state visit is an unusual honor. At the White House in February, Mr. Starmer handed the president a letter from King Charles inviting Mr. Trump to return.What is on the agenda?The president and the first lady will receive a ceremonial welcome on Wednesday at Windsor Castle, a royal home and fortress for more than 900 years.A guard of honor will greet them, followed by lunch with the royal family. Mr. Trump will watch a fly-past by the Red Arrows, the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force, and American F-35 military jets, and there will be a military event known as Beating Retreat, a colorful display of music and drill.ImagePresident Trump, Queen Elizabeth, Melania Trump, with then Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, in Buckingham Palace during Mr. Trump’s first state visit to Britain in 2019.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesOn Thursday, the president will travel to Chequers, the official country residence of the British prime minister, where he will be greeted by Mr. Starmer and his wife, Victoria. The two leaders are likely to address a news conference in the afternoon. Before that they are expected to visit the Winston Churchill archives at Chequers and join a business reception.Mrs. Trump will remain at Windsor, where she will see Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House with Queen Camilla, and later join Catherine, Princess of Wales, at Frogmore Gardens for an event with Britain’s Scouts Association.Are protests planned?Yes. On Tuesday, organizers called on protesters to gather in Windsor’s High Street, not far from the castle. For Wednesday, they have scheduled a demonstration in London culminating in a march to Parliament Square.The state visit program has been designed to limit security risks, as well as minimizing the opportunity for protesters to confront a president who is broadly unpopular with the British public. The carriage procession will take place inside the royal grounds at Windsor, and the formal agenda does not include events in central London.Are state visits purely ceremonial, or are they political, too?State visits can be an important geopolitical tool for the government of the day. Given Mr. Trump’s longstanding admiration for the royal family, many analysts viewed the invitation that Mr. Starmer personally delivered to him in February as a potent diplomatic device that helped build their relationship.ImageA security fence near Windsor Castle on Tuesday, a day before President Trump and Melania Trump, the first lady, were scheduled to arrive.Credit...Hannah McKay/ReutersMr. Starmer, a former lawyer who leads the center-left Labour Party, has gone out of his way to try to cultivate Mr. Trump.Britain’s main foreign policy objective is to solidify support for Ukraine and to persuade Mr. Trump to increase pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin — particularly following Russia’s recent drone incursions into NATO airspace. Mr. Starmer has been at pains not to criticize Mr. Trump’s stance on international issues, but Britain has diverged from U.S. policy on the war in Gaza, promising to recognize a Palestinian state unless the Israeli government changes course.John Yoon contributed reporting.Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.See more on: British Royal Family, Queen Camilla, King Charles III, Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain , Keir Starmer, Melania TrumpShare full articleRelated ContentSKIP",

    "title": "U.S. Government to Invest $75 Million in Ukraine’s Minerals",
    "content": "SKIP The U.S. government on Wednesday pledged $75 million to kick-start a landmark deal to invest in Ukraine’s vast mineral reserves, a commitment that will ease fears in Kyiv that the Trump administration is walking away from the war-torn country.When an agreement this spring granted the United States a stake in Ukraine’s critical minerals, Kyiv cast it as a way to lock in American support through business ties. President Trump had made clear he would no longer give U.S. money to Ukraine for the war effort, leaving Kyiv scrambling to retain whatever American engagement it could.Many observers doubted that the deal could draw U.S. investment while the fighting raged. But the new American pledge and a matching commitment by the Ukrainian government will bring a fund created under the agreement to $150 million.“By deploying this initial capital, we aim to catalyze private-sector investments in Ukraine through the fund’s investments, to rebuild critical infrastructure, unlock nature resources and generate economic prosperity for the United States and Ukraine,” Conor Coleman, head of investments at the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, or D.F.C., the government agency behind the investments, said in a statement.The flow of U.S. government money into Ukraine’s minerals, hydrocarbons and related infrastructure could help reassure private investors and attract badly needed capital to sustain the country’s war economy.It also shows the new mercantile nature of the U.S.-Ukrainian alliance under Mr. Trump. While the Biden administration spent tens of billions of dollars to aid Kyiv, Washington now focuses on opportunities to profit through investments and sales. It provides weapons to Ukraine only through purchases facilitated by a NATO-backed procurement system that uses European funds.Aware of the U.S. president’s business-oriented mind-set, Kyiv hopes to give Mr. Trump a stake in Ukraine’s future through the mineral investment, especially as he has grown frustrated with his diplomatic efforts to end the war and hinted at possibly stepping back.The U.S. investment “is a sign of trust and long-term commitment of our partners,” Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s prime minister, said in a statement. “American investments can be a guarantee of security both for Ukraine and for American business in Ukraine.”ImagePresident Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the White House last month. The minerals deal shows the new mercantile nature of the U.S.-Ukrainian alliance under Mr. Trump. Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesSigned in the spring after months of tense negotiations, the deal gives the United States special access to investment projects in natural resources in Ukraine, which hold a potential value of trillions of dollars. Under the agreement, a company seeking to develop a mineral site and needing investors must first present its project to the fund created by the deal.While the fund is jointly owned by the United States and Ukraine, Washington retains some control over it. The D.F.C. was appointed to lead its board this month.The $150 million investment announced on Wednesday will provide the fund’s initial capital, but most of its future contributions are expected to come from Kyiv. Under the deal, half of the revenues the Ukrainian government earns from extracting minerals and selling licenses will flow into the fund.Profits will then be reinvested in Ukraine’s economy, with the United States also claiming a portion. Mr. Trump has portrayed the arrangement as repayment for past U.S. aid.In an effort to push the deal forward, Kyiv has pitched Washington projects to exploit deposits of lithium, graphite and titanium, three minerals the United States has identified as critical for its economy and national security. The Kyiv School of Economics says Ukraine holds the largest titanium reserves in Europe and a third of Europe’s reserves of lithium, which is used to produce electric batteries.Ukraine officially opened bidding for its first project on Friday, at the Dobra lithium field, one of the largest in Ukraine. TechMet, an energy investment firm partly owned by the U.S. government, has announced that it will make a bid. But the bidding could face a legal challenge, as Critical Metals Corporation, an American company, claims to hold the rights to mine the site.In recent days, a D.F.C. delegation scouted other sites in central Ukraine that could become pilot projects., including a mining and processing plant and a deposit owned by Velta Holding, a titanium producer. Titanium is critical for producing aircraft and medical implants.Industry analysts say the path to extracting Ukraine’s minerals is filled with challenges, including complex licensing procedures and outdated geological surveys that cloud the true value of Ukrainian subsoil.Perhaps the greatest challenge is Russia’s continued advance on the battlefield.In July, its troops seized a valuable lithium deposit in the eastern Donetsk region. Moscow’s forces, which already control vast mineral resources through their occupation of roughly a fifth of Ukraine, are also getting closer to deposits of titanium and uranium in eastern Ukraine.Potential investors may also be unnerved by recent Russian airstrikes on or near Western assets, including an American factory in western Ukraine. Ukrainian officials and analysts have viewed the strikes as a warning from Moscow that the West’s assets may not be safe in Ukraine, and that the bloc should back off from investing in a country that Russia has long seen as its economic backyard.Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.A version of this article appears in print on , Section A, Page 9 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. to Invest $75 Million in Ukraine’s Minerals.

    "content": "Facial recognition vans are being used by police across London.Credit...Charlotte Hadden for The New York TimesSupported bySKIP Listen to this article · 8:11 min Learn moreShare full articleBy Adam Satariano and Lizzie DeardenReporting from LondonSept. 17, 2025As a couple with a stroller walked by a police van adorned with cameras on one of London’s busiest shopping streets this month, officers stopped the man for questioning. After several minutes, they put him in handcuffs and took him away.Such scenes have become increasingly common as British authorities have ramped up the use of live facial recognition. Since January 2024, more than 1,000 people have been charged or cited in London with the help of the technology, which scans people’s faces and compares their image in real time to a database of about 16,000 wanted individuals, according to the police.British authorities have also recently expanded oversight of online speech, tried weakening encryption and experimented with artificial intelligence to review asylum claims. The actions, which have accelerated under Prime Minister Keir Starmer with the goal of addressing societal problems, add up to one of the most sweeping embraces of digital surveillance and internet regulation by a Western democracy.That has put Britain at the forefront of a debate over the choices that democracies will have to make about security, privacy, civil liberties and governing in the digital age. Critics contend that the nation has gone too far, intruding on the daily lives of citizens with technology and regulation. But others argue the measures are a pragmatic adaptation to technological change to strengthen safety and national security.“There’s a big philosophical debate going on here,” said Ryan Wain, the executive director of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London group started by the former prime minister that supports the government’s policies. “There’s a big question about what is freedom and what is safety.”In a statement, Britain’s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, which oversees digital policy, said the public expected the government to utilize modern technology.“We make no apologies for using the latest tools to help tackle crime, protect children online and secure our borders while safeguarding freedoms and ensuring the internet is safe for everyone,” a spokesman said. “Our focus is on safety and national security, not unnecessary intrusion.”For years, the British government sacrificed some privacy and civil liberties for security and public safety. After terrorist attacks and other crimes, London installed more CCTV security cameras than almost any other comparable city. A 2016 law called the Investigatory Powers Act, also known as the “Snoopers Charter,” gave intelligence agencies and the police vast powers to intercept communications and review online activity.ImageCredit...Charlotte Hadden for The New York TimesThe latest policies build on that tradition.This year, the government expanded internet regulation with a new law aimed at preventing children from accessing online pornography and content that might encourage self-harm, suicide or eating disorders. In July, the law, called the Online Safety Act and passed under the previous Conservative government, introduced age verification checks for Reddit, Instagram and other services. Civil liberties campaigners have said it weakens privacy, while child safety groups have said the requirements can be easily evaded or ignored.In July, Nigel Farage, whose populist Reform U.K. party leads in national polls, called for the repeal of the law, arguing it was a form of censorship and “borderline dystopian.” He has also criticized the recent arrests of people for social media posts that were made under old laws against hate speech and incitement.Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of Ofcom, the agency implementing the new online safety law, said the new policies were essential for protecting children and did not infringe on speech.“There’s no silver bullets here,” she said in an interview. “But our job is to drive change and we’re beginning to do that.”ImageMelanie Dawes, the chief executive of Ofcom.Credit...Charlotte Hadden for The New York TimesAs President Trump visits Britain this week, the tech debate has also taken on trans-Atlantic significance. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers recently criticized Britain’s online safety law as an attack on both free speech and U.S. tech companies. This month, Mr. Farage testified at a congressional hearing in Washington about perceived threats to free speech in Britain.The Trump administration also intervened in February after Britain ordered Apple to create an easy way for intelligence agencies and law enforcement officials to retrieve encrypted user data stored on the company’s servers. Last month, Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. national intelligence director, said Britain had dropped the demand after American officials stepped in. British authorities have declined to comment.ImageThe Trump administration and Republican lawmakers recently criticized Britain’s online safety law as an attack on both free speech and U.S. tech companies.Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesOver the past year, Britain has also expanded the use of artificial intelligence and algorithmic tools to handle immigration, including using the technologies to screen asylum applications, as well as exploring the introduction of digital IDs.A spokesman for the Home Office, which manages immigration, said the moves have helped process a backlog of asylum claims and have enabled “human caseworkers, who will always be in charge of taking decisions, to reduce the time they have to spend on lengthy administrative tasks.”But the technologies have raised concerns among some government workers, who question how effectively caseworkers can oversee A.I. and lament the lack of laws regulating its usage. If asylum decisions involving A.I. are legally challenged, one official said, Britain’s specialist immigration courts could get clogged with appeals and slow the system down.Facial recognition has been perhaps the most visible sign of Britain’s expanding tech policies. Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at the privacy group Big Brother Watch, said the country had deployed the tools far more than other democracies.“There has to be limits,” he said, noting that the European Union recently adopted a law to limit the use of facial recognition.Gavin Stephens, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said the faces of innocent people were not stored by authorities. Last month at the Notting Hill Carnival, an annual street festival to celebrate Caribbean culture, 61 arrests were made of individuals identified by live facial recognition, including some wanted for violent offenses and crimes against women.ImageA police van using facial-recognition cameras at the Notting Hill Carnival in West London in August.Credit...Carlos Jasso/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“Why wouldn’t you use this sort of technology if there were people who were wanted for serious offenses and were a risk to public safety?” Mr. Stephens said in an interview. “It’s definitely an important thing for the future.”Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan Police in London, wants to go further. At a conference in Westminster this month, he said facial recognition would be integrated into officers’ phones so they could switch it on to “confirm suspects’ identities on the street more efficiently.” Authorities are also testing affixing permanent facial recognition cameras in certain areas of London.A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said the technology was accurate, with only one person being misidentified in 2024 out of more than 33,000 cases.Prison authorities are also expanding their use of A.I. In July, the Ministry of Justice, which oversees the prison system, introduced an “A.I. Action Plan” that includes a...",

    "title": "Most U.K. Political Leaders Are Cautiously Welcoming Trump. Not This One.",
    "content": "SKIP When President Trump arrives at Windsor Castle on Wednesday morning for his state visit there will be no complaints from the Conservatives, the country’s traditional center-right party. Nigel Farage, the right-wing populist leader of Reform U.K., will surely rejoice at the presence of Mr. Trump, an ally on British soil.And although polling suggests that the U.S. president is unpopular with a majority of the British public, even Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose center-left Labour Party is the country’s equivalent of the Democrats, is more likely to roll out the red carpet than even whisper a criticism about the president. His diplomatic strategy since Mr. Trump took office has been to woo him with praise and deference.Of the leaders of the three parties with the highest number of lawmakers in Parliament, only one is prepared to openly criticize Mr. Trump. Ed Davey, of the centrist Liberal Democrats, will record his dissatisfaction with the president by refusing to attend a state dinner hosted on Wednesday by King Charles III.“I personally do not think he represents the best of American values,” Mr. Davey said in a recent interview, where he accused Mr. Trump of undermining the close relationship between Britain and the United States. “He certainly doesn’t share the values that I felt have been at the base of that special relationship.”Mr. Davey has called Mr. Trump a “bully” and a “threat to peace and prosperity.” He says the American president is the instigator of a “destructive trade war” causing economic pain for British citizens. And he accuses Mr. Trump of “betraying Ukraine,” saying: “It’s not only their sovereignty he’s selling out. It’s our security. The security of Europe and the security of our United Kingdom.”ImageFlags on display in Windsor, England, ahead of President Trump’s state visit to Britain on Tuesday.Credit...Carl Court/Getty ImagesHe said his decision to skip the banquet was a difficult one because of his respect for the country’s top royal. He and his wife, Emily, who are Christian, prayed about it, he said when he announced the decision, noting, “There is no honor like an invitation from the king.”But Mr. Davey said he wanted to send a message to Mr. Trump about the need to end the war in Gaza by putting pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.“It is clear, it’s always been clear, that Trump could end it, and I don’t think he’s put under any scrutiny whatsoever,” he said.Mr. Davey’s willingness to call out Mr. Trump makes him a lonely voice among Britain’s leading politicians, even though the Labour Party, which is on the left of the Liberal Democrats, won power last year after 14 years of Conservative rule.Mr. Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, might have seemed destined to clash with Mr. Trump. But the prime minister has chosen a different path.During his first meeting with the U.S. leader in the Oval Office in February, Mr. Starmer waved aside a question on Mr. Trump’s musings about annexing Canada, saying, “I think you’re trying to find a divide between us that doesn’t exist.”On that same occasion, Mr. Starmer delivered an invitation for Mr. Trump to make his second state visit to Britain. The first was in 2019.Later, the prime minister said of the U.S. president: “I like and respect him. I understand what he’s trying to achieve.” Mr. Trump told reporters that he and Mr. Starmer had “become friends in a short period of time.”ImageMr. Trump with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain at the White House in February, when Mr. Starmer delivered an invitation for Mr. Tump to visit Britain.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesAll of which annoys Mr. Davey to no end.He said Mr. Starmer was being too soft on the president, especially over Gaza. Mr. Davey also accused Mr. Starmer of not working hard enough to rebuild ties to Europe so that Britain would no longer be so dependent on the United States.“He’s done a bit of that, but it’s pretty weak,” Mr. Davey said of the prime minister. “He hasn’t, in my view, had the political courage.”In Britain, a new, fierce multi-way competition among the political parties, including Reform U.K., which is leading in the polls, has weakened Mr. Starmer’s position. The country’s stuttering economy has underscored the importance of its relationship with America, a key trade partner. The constant ego stroking appeared to work when Mr. Trump agreed to a trade deal that imposed lower tariffs than those for the European Union or other countries.Mr. Farage, who campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016, has in many ways fashioned himself in Mr. Trump’s image. He vigorously denounces migrants and has pledged mass deportations. He has echoed Mr. Trump’s populist speech and, in the past, has praised Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia. In early September, Mr. Farage shared a photo of himself in the Oval Office with a grinning Mr. Trump.ImageNigel Farage, the leaders of Reform U.K., at the party’s national conference in Birmingham, England, in September.Credit...Phil Noble/ReutersKemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservatives, has urged her colleagues to follow in Mr. Trump’s footsteps on issues like climate change, immigration and free speech as she tries to help the party reclaim relevance.“Take a look at President Trump,” she said in a speech in February. “He’s shown that sometimes you need that first stint in government to spot the problems, but it’s the second time around when you really know how to fix them.”The support for the president by Mr. Farage and Ms. Badenoch is hardly surprising. And Mr. Davey said that in some ways, his decision not to attend the state dinner was not aimed directly at Mr. Trump.“I’m humble enough and realistic enough to know that Donald Trump doesn’t give a monkey about what the leader of the British Liberal Democrats says,” Mr. Davey said. “It wasn’t really a message to him. It was much more a message to Starmer.”Michael D.

    "title": "Navalny Vomited and Convulsed in Prison Before Dying, His Wife Says",
    "content": "SKIP Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, suffered from heavy vomiting and convulsions shortly before he died in an Arctic prison last year, according to what the organization he founded called new information it had collected.His wife and political successor, Yulia Navalnaya, claimed on Wednesday that the details supported her accusation that Mr. Navalny had been poisoned on Russian government orders, though she did not provide direct evidence.In a 15-minute video posted on social media, she described what she said was a photo of Mr. Navalny’s prison cell showing vomit on the floor on the day he died, as well as excerpts from what she said were official incident reports submitted by five prison officials. She also said that her team had obtained biological samples from Mr. Navalny’s body and sent them for analysis in two countries.Ms. Navalnaya did not explain how her organization had obtained the documents she cited in the video, and their authenticity could not be independently verified. She also did not say how biological samples had been obtained or where exactly they had been tested, though she claimed that the results pointed to poisoning.“Aleksei was murdered,” she said, echoing the main assertion made by Mr. Navalny’s exiled organization, the Anti-Corruption Foundation, after his death. “More specifically, poisoned.”The Kremlin spokesman on Wednesday declined to comment on her latest assertions.Mr. Navalny, the Russian government’s most prominent political opponent, died in a maximum-security prison in the Russian Arctic on Feb. 16, 2024, from what officials claimed were natural causes. He had been serving a three-decade sentence on extremism-related charges.His imprisonment was widely seen in Russia and abroad as politically motivated, and he had persistently maintained his innocence in the cases against him.International rights organizations and Western governments broadly agree that the Russian government is ultimately responsible for Mr. Navalny’s death because its agents poisoned him in 2020 and subjected him to inhumane conditions after jailing him the following year. But U.S. intelligence officials determined last year it was unlikely that the Kremlin had been directly involved in the events that led to his death.Ms. Navalnaya asserted on Wednesday that the reports by prison officials said that Mr. Navalny’s health had suddenly deteriorated during a morning walk on the day of his death. He asked guards for help but received inadequate care, she said.“He was not even taken to an infirmary; they just took him back to his cell No. 16,” Ms. Navalnaya said in the video, citing what she said were written testimonies submitted by prison guards to their superiors.“Aleksei lay down on the floor, pulled his legs up to his stomach and started groaning from pain,” she said. “He said that his chest and stomach were burning. Then he began to vomit.”Ms. Navalnaya presented a photo of what she said was his cell, which showed part of the floor covered with large quantities of liquid resembling vomit.By the time he was taken to the infirmary, Mr. Navalny had lost consciousness, Ms. Navalnaya said. Medical workers who arrived in an ambulance soon after pronounced him dead.The preliminary cause of death logged by the medical workers was “sudden death syndrome,\" Ms. Navalnaya said.Anatoly Kurmanaev covers Russia and its transformation following the invasion of Ukraine.A version of this article appears in print on , Section A, Page 9 of the New York edition with the headline: New Signs of Poisoning, Navalny’s Wife Claims.

    "title": "Israel’s Assault on Gaza City Stifles Hope of Diplomatic Resolution to War",
    "content": "SKIP As Israeli troops launched a ground assault aimed at taking control of Gaza City, experts said the operation showed that diplomatic efforts to end the war appear severely diminished, if not moribund.What is clear after nearly two years of intense fighting that has left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins is that neither side intends to back down from its longstanding objectives.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said from the outset of the war that he had two priorities: to bring home the hostages captured by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attacks and to destroy Hamas.But the goal of eradicating Hamas has been a challenge for Mr. Netanyahu to define. Even if Israel vanquishes the group, its ideology will most likely survive the war. And the objective itself raises questions. Once Israel declares success, who will govern Gaza? Mr. Netanyahu has suggested unspecified “Arab forces,” but his additional requirements, like keeping the Palestinian Authority out of power in Gaza, make the idea a nonstarter in Arab countries.For their part, leaders of Hamas have long sought to eliminate the state of Israel and had hoped the 2023 attacks would force the world to reckon with Palestinian statehood. As well as killing about 1,200 people, the group and its allies also took about 250 hostages as leverage against a ground war with Israel. Hamas had calculated that to free those captives, the Israeli military must pull out of Gaza — an outcome that would leave the group fundamentally intact and claiming victory. That thinking, of course, has not worked out in the ways Hamas would have hoped. Whatever leverage Hamas had with the hostages appears gone, and the war has badly damaged Hamas’s fighting capabilities.The intransigence on both sides is a steep barrier for any negotiations toward a cease-fire or a peace deal. Neither Hamas nor Mr. Netanyahu has shown interest in giving up political power or influence in exchange for peace. For Mr. Netanyahu, that means ensuring his government does not fall. Hamas has not demonstrated a willingness to surrender its weapons or to loosen its grip on Gaza.An Israeli airstrike on Sept. 9 that targeted Hamas officials in Qatar, which has served as an intermediary between Israel and Hamas, undermined existing diplomatic efforts. Officials from Qatar and other Arab countries denounced the strike as an insult to Qatar’s efforts to negotiate peace.“We have two stubborn enemies,” said Prof. Mkhaimar Abusada, a Palestinian political scientist at Al-Azhar University in Gaza who was displaced during the war and now lives in Cairo. “Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas and Hamas is trying to survive. They have completely divergent goals.”ImageSmoke rises to the sky following an Israeli military strike in the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday.Credit...Leo Correa/Associated Press“Diplomacy is dead,” Mr. Abusada added.Secretary of State Marco Rubio signaled a similarly dim conclusion on Tuesday, saying that “time is running out” for any prospects of ending the war. He spoke just before leaving Israel for Qatar and as Israeli forces began their assault on Gaza City, which Israel sees as a major Hamas stronghold. It was unclear whether he knew at the time that the offensive had begun.While in Israel, Mr. Rubio acknowledged that any chance of diplomacy to halt the war soon was unlikely. It was a sobering assessment that captured the reality of the moment: Mediation efforts by the Trump administration, Qatar and Egypt have so far failed.Neither side in the war has shown any signs of backing down despite steep costs for both.Hamas’s leadership and its remaining fighters have refused to relent in the face of enormous destruction in Gaza and the deaths of more than 60,000 Palestinians, a total that comes from Gazan health officials, who don’t distinguish between combatants and civilians.Israel has endured military casualties, internal anger over the government’s refusal to stop the war to free the remaining hostages, harm to its image around the world and accusations of genocide, which it has denied.Still, Mr. Netanyahu and his political allies persist in Gaza, even over some objections from the country’s military establishment. In some ways, the Israeli government appeared to be doubling down.ImageThousands of protesters, including families of hostages, marched in Tel Aviv last month.Credit...Amit Elkayam for The New York Times“Gaza is burning,” its defense minister, Israel Katz, wrote Tuesday on social media. He said that the Israeli military intended both to defeat Hamas and to force the group to return the remaining Israeli hostages, adding, “We will not relent or turn back — until the mission is completed.”Those two goals have always been at odds.Israeli military operations targeting Hamas militants run the risk of inadvertently killing Israeli hostages or prompting Hamas to kill them as Israeli forces close in. Israel believes about 20 living hostages are still in Gaza.Conversely, Hamas has demanded a cease-fire in exchange for agreeing to return hostages. That would give the organization time to regroup and strengthen itself, thus undermining Israel’s goal to destroy it.“If you destroy Hamas, how will you get your hostages back?” said Shira Efron, an expert in Israeli and Middle Eastern affairs at RAND Corporation, which studies security matters and other issues.Mr. Katz has said that the war will not stop until “Hamas’s defeat is clear and absolute.” Experts have questioned what that means. Israeli tank shells and missiles cannot eradicate Hamas’s deep ties to the land, nor obliterate its members’ beliefs. Though the United States and its allies crippled Al Qaeda’s leadership and operations, for example, the organization still exists in a weakened form, attracting followers and fomenting violence.Killing Hamas’s current leader in Gaza, Izz al-Din al-Haddad, would probably not end the fighting in the enclave. It is unlikely Hamas would expose all its fighters in a direct confrontation with superior Israeli forces. Such evasion has been a familiar Hamas tactic in the war — one that ensures the group still has enough personnel and firepower to fight another day and to remain politically relevant. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it estimated that at least 2,000 Hamas militants remained in Gaza City.Yet diplomacy has paid off in previous conflicts between the two sides. Israel and Hamas agreed to cease-fires after intense fighting in 2014 and 2021. Since the war started, they have hashed out two pauses in hostilities that included the release of scores of hostages.ImageQatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, accused Israel of “sabotaging” the cease-fire and hostage-release negotiations.Credit...Pool photo by Nathan Howard“The partial deals made us all think that we could bridge both sides toward the implementation of a more durable agreement,” Ms. Efron said.In recent weeks, an intensive diplomatic push unfolded. Mediators met in Doha, the Qatari capital, to hammer out a deal. President Trump said on Sept. 7 that the Israelis had accepted a set of terms, including a possible proposal to exchange all remaining hostages for Palestinian prisoners and end the war. He called on Hamas to do the same. Hamas acknowledged it had received “some ideas from the American side” and was ready to begin talks.But two days later, the Israeli airstrike on Hamas officials in Qatar killed the son of a leading figure involved in the planning of the Oct. 7 attacks. Four others associated with the militant group were also killed. Qatari officials have said they hosted the Hamas officials at the request of the United States.Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, accused Israel of “sabotaging” the cease-fire and hostage-release negotiations.ImagePalestinian families fleeing Gaza City on Tuesday.

    "title": "Trump’s Birthday Call to Modi Raises Hopes in India for a Trade Deal",
    "content": "SKIP President Trump dialed Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, on the eve of his 75th birthday to wish him well, signaling a possible rapprochement after months of tensions about tariffs and about who deserved credit for a cease-fire between India and Pakistan.“Just had a wonderful phone call with my friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social. “I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job.” Mr. Trump also referred to Mr. Modi as Narendra, in a rare instance of using his given name.The call came during a visit by U.S. trade officials to New Delhi to discuss a possible trade deal with officials from India’s Commerce Ministry. It was the first since June 17, when Mr. Modi told Mr. Trump that India had directly negotiated a cease-fire with Pakistan after a brief conflict in May — despite the U.S. president’s insistence that it was his doing.Mr. Modi, who celebrated his birthday on Wednesday, posted a similarly warm message on social media thanking Mr. Trump for his call and birthday wishes. “Like you, I am also fully committed to taking the India-U.S. Comprehensive and Global Partnership to new heights.”Trade talks and tariff negotiations have continued since the spring but became enmeshed in geopolitics when Mr. Trump and senior U.S. officials began accusing India of financing Russia’s war on Ukraine by purchasing large quantities of its oil. Late last month, Mr. Trump punished India for continuing to buy Russian oil by doubling total tariffs to 50 percent on all U.S. imports of Indian goods.Last week, the two leaders had restored some of the bonhomie that had characterized their relationship, raising hopes that they were no longer deadlocked on trade.On Sept. 10, Mr. Trump posted that he was looking forward to speaking with his “very good friend” Mr. Modi. He said trade negotiations would continue and expressed certainty that the two countries would successfully close a deal.This week, the two leaders affirmed via social media that India supported U.S. efforts to end Russia’s war with Ukraine.India and the United States have struggled to arrive at a bilateral trade agreement, partly because the South Asian giant has been unwilling to make concessions or open up certain markets.On Wednesday, the Indian government said in a news release that discussions on a bilateral trade agreement were “positive” and that both sides had decided to “intensify efforts” to reach a deal quickly.Anupreeta Das covers India and South Asia for The Times.

    "title": "Denmark to Buy Long-Range Weapons in ‘Paradigm Shift’",
    "content": "SKIP Denmark is beefing up its arsenal.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced that the country will acquire, for the first time, long-range precision weapons, calling it “a paradigm shift in Danish defense policy.” She framed the move as a response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying, “There is no doubt that Russia will be a threat to Denmark and Europe for many years to come.”Ms. Frederiksen did not specify which weapon systems the government would buy but stressed that Denmark intended to use the new weapons as a deterrent, not to launch an offensive war.“We are not the ones attacking,” she said. “Russia is.”Russia responded harshly to the Danish announcement, calling the plans “pure madness” and suggesting Denmark’s purchase was an overt threat to Moscow.“No one, anywhere, ever in the world has considered threatening a nuclear power publicly,” Vladimir Barbin, Russia’s ambassador to Denmark, said in a statement. “These statements will no doubt be taken into account.”Denmark is a small European country, but as a member of NATO it has recently laid out billions of dollars to rebuild its military. That move is part of a wider push across Europe, including among Denmark’s Nordic neighbors, to amp up military spending in response to rising geopolitical tensions and the United States’ increasing standoffishness toward global alliances. Earlier this month, Norway signed a $13.5 billion deal with Britain to buy a new fleet of frigates — the largest military purchase in Norway’s history.In recent months, Denmark has ordered three new Arctic patrol ships, bought long-range drones and strengthened its satellite coverage over Greenland. The gigantic and geopolitically valuable island in the Arctic Circle, which is a semiautonomous Danish overseas territory, has recently become a sore subject with the Trump administration. President Trump has repeatedly said the United States should take over the island, but the Danish government and most Greenlanders don’t want that.Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Denmark has also become one of Kyiv’s most committed backers. It has sent over $11 billion in military and civilian aid, including F-16 fighter jets, artillery and tanks.Danish officials did not say how much they planned to spend on the long-range weapons, adding that they were still evaluating different systems.“The goal is to buy weapons that we never have to use,” said Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the country’s foreign minister.Jeffrey Gettleman is an international correspondent based in London covering global events.

    "title": "Europe’s far-right and Charlie Kirk",
    "content": "SKIP ImageProtesters in London at a far-right rally on Saturday.Credit...Jaimi Joy/ReutersEurope’s far right is claiming Charlie Kirk as a martyrOver the past decade, I’ve spent a lot of time writing about Europe’s far right: Marine Le Pen’s ascent in France, the Brexit vote in Britain and the rise of the AfD in Germany. In 2019, I took a road trip across the Continent and was struck by how much these movements differed from country to country. The Italian right was animated by immigration. In France, it was the urban elite’s betrayal of the rural left-behind. Polish nationalists were obsessed with all things L.G.B.T.Q.It was in 2019 that Steve Bannon, the then in-house ideologue for President Trump, traveled Europe’s capitals in an effort to unite the far right. That effort fizzled. But something is happening more organically now.After the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the American right-wing activist, I was eager to talk to my colleague Jason Horowitz, who spent the weekend at a far-right rally, where leaders of these parties converged from all over Europe.Katrin: Jason, you were at this far-right rally in Madrid last weekend with party leaders from across Europe and beyond. What were people saying about Charlie Kirk?Jason: There are these common themes you always hear about at these rallies: Immigration, sovereignty, an encroaching European Union. But the new thing that everyone was talking about was Charlie Kirk. That shouldn’t have been surprising, because lots of these parties have been developing a narrative — or mythology — of persecution for years, sometimes decades. And they took the assassination of Kirk as more evidence of their persecution. As one of the party leaders explained to me, they needed to “use him” for political mobilization. In a way, it would be political malpractice not to.Katrin: You were in Italy when Bannon tried, in 2019, to unify Europe’s far right, and it didn’t work. Could Charlie Kirk achieve, posthumously, what Bannon failed to do?Jason: Bannon had identified Italy as the center of the new populism in Europe, and I saw his effort up close to try to sign up people for this thing he had called The Movement. One reason it didn’t work was that Europeans had a sense it was primarily about Bannon. Charlie Kirk had a more organic online connection to many on the right in Europe, especially the young. He was in their phones, in reels translated into their own languages. That someone they sort of knew and watched was killed on camera was powerful. And one leader of a European right-wing party told me that it mattered that this had happened in America, which has in many ways taken the lead in the right-wing echo chamber. So they were more than willing to accept Kirk as a martyr of their own.Katrin: And what does that say about the state of the global far right?Jason: It shows that the right-wing ecosystem has already become more aligned. And that’s a result of social media and the immediacy of X and Instagram and YouTube. But it also reflects something more purposeful: a strategy of these parties to draw closer together. They make a point of speaking at each other’s rallies. They share the same issues, and the same politically useful mythology of victimization. So those factors make something as enormous in the United States as Charlie Kirk’s assassination reverberate in Europe and beyond.TOP NEWSImageCredit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesMaximum pomp for Trump in the U.K.On the first day of his state visit to Britain, President Trump and his wife, Melania, attended a lavish state dinner at Windsor Castle. King Charles III welcomed Trump to the banquet by praising the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States.

    "content": "So Yim-ha advertising dim sum on a cart at Metropol, one of Hong Kong’s largest dim sum restaurants.Credit...Supported bySKIP Listen to this article · 7:18 min Learn moreShare full articleBy David Pierson and Berry WangVisuals by Billy H.C. KwokDavid Pierson and Berry Wang gorged on dim sum while reporting from Metropol, a soon-to-be-shuttered banquet hall in the heart of Hong Kong Island.Sept. 18, 2025Updated 2:46 a.m. ETIt was nearing peak lunch service on a recent weekday at the Metropol, one of Hong Kong’s largest dim sum restaurants, when So Yim-ha emerged from the kitchen into the cavernous dining hall pushing a stainless steel cart stacked high with bamboo steamers.Fighting to be heard over the din of the room filled with hundreds of customers, Ms. So cleared her throat and began advertising the small, scrumptious dishes in her cart.“Pork ribs! Beef meatballs! Quail egg siu mai!”ImageThe cavernous dining hall at Metropol occupies the fourth floor of a retail and office building on Hong Kong Island.VideoOrdering dim sum at a station.One by one, the baskets went as Ms. So and other servers crisscrossed the floor, stopping at each table to present their offerings. Diners pointed at the dishes, enticed by the perfume of soy and steamed shrimp in rice rolls, the earthy aroma of lotus leaves wrapped around glutinous rice with sausage, and the sight of fluffy barbecued pork buns or glistening yellow egg tarts.If someone ordered the beef meatballs, Ms. So would squirt the dish with Worcestershire sauce, as is customary. She would recommend other dishes like the stuffed green peppers or the soup dumplings, her personal favorites. With every sale, she stamped a white card that tallied orders, thanked the customers and moved on to the next table.ImageBamboo baskets filled with pork ribs, tripe, chicken feet and tofu skin rolls are readied in Metropol’s kitchen.ImageMs. So, who has worked at Metropol for 25 years, prides herself in schmoozing with customers. “I don’t just serve dim sum, I’m also happy to chitchat with the customers and tell them what’s good to eat,” she said.It’s this intimate interaction — street stall meets banquet hall, if you will — that distinguishes traditional parlors like the Metropol from other dim sum experiences on offer in Hong Kong. (And the city has many, including Michelin-starred restaurants, holes-in-the-wall, and for those craving it on the go, or at odd hours, 7-Eleven stores.)But the Metropol, one of only a handful of restaurants that still use carts, will close for good on Sept. 27, after 35 years in business. And along with it, a beloved fixture of Hong Kong dining will fade away: the dim sum cart auntie.ImageRoasting a suckling pig.VideoPreparing dim sum in the kitchen.For decades, the typically middle-aged women have become as synonymous with the dim sum experience as the famous shrimp dumplings and phoenix’s claw (a.k.a. steamed chicken feet) that have come to define this Cantonese style of dining of small dishes washed down with tea.The women can be equal parts charming and gruff, as service staff tend to be in Hong Kong. But they always add a human touch to one of the city’s most cherished rituals in a way that a server with a menu could never.“It’s not the easiest job,” said Mamoru Hayashi, whose family owns the company that founded Metropol and two other restaurants in Hong Kong. “It’s hard to push those carts. You also have to be friendly, outgoing and loud enough so the customers can hear your voice.”Large restaurants like the Metropol, which are big enough to roll out dim sum carts, are a throwback to the high-flying decades starting in the 1980s when Hong Kong was flush with cash from a booming Chinese economy next door. Ms. So, 62, who has worked for nearly half her life at the Metropol, can barely see over her cart, which she hunches over as she plows her way through the thick carpeting. She wears a white paper hat and a pressed white uniform with a traditional Chinese collar, and prides herself on her ability to schmooze.“I don’t just serve dim sum, I’m also happy to chitchat with the customers and tell them what’s good to eat,” she said. “The regulars like to ask about my health and I always ask about their children.”Ms. So, like the nearly dozen other dim sum cart aunties on staff, wept when she learned this summer that the restaurant would close. She said that she has worked with the team for so long that they feel like family. The modest monthly pay of between 7,000 and 14,000 Hong Kong dollars, or $900 and $1,800, was a godsend to her, given how few jobs are available for older and less-skilled workers like her.“It makes me so sad,” she said. “I have no idea what I’ll do next.”The closure is also a reflection of Hong Kong’s changing fortunes. Large restaurants like the Metropol, which are big enough to roll out dim sum carts, are a throwback to the high-flying decades starting in the 1980s when Hong Kong was flush with cash from a booming Chinese economy next door.ImageThere’s always room for dessert after all the savory dumplings. The jelly cubes are a decidedly retro option that lives on at Metropol.ImageMango rolls are another Metropol favorite, a sweet companion to the typical rolled rice sheets stuffed with shrimp, beef or barbecued pork.Profits streamed in for such restaurants as they hosted dinner banquets for weddings, industry groups and clan associations, where hundreds of guests could be feted with expensive seafood and French cognac. Back then, the breakfast and lunchtime dim sum services were less important to a restaurant’s bottom line, especially as the most common dishes were about 40 Hong Kong dollars, or $5. Customers could sit for hours gossiping over a few steamers and sip tea without raising an eyebrow from the staff.Today’s economics do not allow for that. Hotels have captured much of the wedding banquet business from stand-alone restaurants. China’s sluggish economy has forced Hong Kongers to tighten their belts. Shenzhen, the metropolis across the mainland border, has emerged as a serious culinary competitor with lower prices. To survive, restaurants in Hong Kong often need to be smaller and leaner.There are only a handful of banquet-style restaurants with dim sum carts left, such as Maxim’s Palace in City Hall, next to the picturesque Victoria Harbor.VideoMaking dumplings by hand.ImageChefs wrap shrimp dumplings, known as har gow. Metropol’s version of the essential dim sum offering is heartier and packed with crunchy shrimp.Keeping the tradition alive all these years has not been easy for the restaurant, which is under pressure to serve the many office workers during their tight lunch breaks. The Metropol complements the pushcarts with a cafeteria-style dim sum station in the middle of the restaurant.Keeping the steamed dumplings hot, and the fried spring rolls and sesame balls crispy, is also a challenge in an operation so big. The wait staff have to be able to read the room and know how much to stock in each cart.“You need constant turnover to keep the dim sum fresh,” said Mr. Hayashi, 46, who represents the third generation in his family’s restaurant business. The family is Japanese with Chinese ancestry and used to operate the oldest Chinese restaurant in Japan.Since Metropol announced in July that it would close, Hong Kongers have been flocking to the restaurant to dine one last time and snap pictures. Customers have been asking if they may take, as souvenirs, the red acrylic signs displayed on each cart that carry the names of dishes. (No, they may not). Workers had to bolt the wheels of a cart parked in the lobby for picture-taking because visitors kept pushing it and pretending to be servers.ImageWorking the dim sum cart at the Metropol.ImageCustomers posing with a cart in the lobby to celebrate Metropol’s 35 years in business.

    "title": "How China Became a Wedge Between Two South Pacific Neighbors",
    "content": "SKIP Every year, tens of thousands of tourists visit the pristine beaches and turquoise lagoons of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific. Their business sustains this small nation of 15 islands and atolls, where no building is taller than a coconut tree.Most travelers come from New Zealand, the Cook Islands’ former colonial ruler, and the two have long had close ties. But in recent months, they have been locked in an icy standoff.The fallout was over a wide-ranging partnership agreement the Cook Islands signed this year with China. The deal, viewed as the latest sign of China’s encroachment in the region, has alarmed New Zealand.New Zealand has put on hold millions of dollars in aid, leaving a hole in the Cook Islands’ budget. Prime Minister Mark Brown of the Cook Islands has threatened to “go somewhere else” for his country’s infrastructure needs. There have been accusations of New Zealand using aid as a bargaining chip, and rare protests in Rarotonga, the main island, by people concerned about jeopardizing ties with New Zealand.Even after the two countries’ leaders met face to face last week at a regional forum, there has been no sign of a breakthrough.“It was a serious change when they entered those arrangements with China, and we knew nothing of it,” New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, said in an interview last month.ImageForeign Minister Tingika Elikana of the Cook Islands, left, and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, meeting in Xiamen, China, in May.Credit...Ding Lin/Xinhua, via Getty ImagesNew Zealand argues that the Cook Islands was obligated to consult with it before signing the deal, and says there will be no new aid until steps are taken to “repair the relationship and restore trust.” Mr. Brown has pointed out that New Zealand signed its own partnership agreement with China in 2014 — without consulting the Cook Islands — reaping tens of billions of dollars in economic gain.But in the decade since that agreement, New Zealand has grown increasingly wary of China’s intentions in its vicinity. It has watched as China used coercive trade measures to hamstring Australia’s economy, test fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific, and sent a naval task force into the waters between Australia and New Zealand to carry out live fire drills.Mr. Peters said that China’s deal with the Cook Islands “fits a certain recent developmental pattern” of Beijing’s ambitions in the region.Diplomats from the Cook Islands and New Zealand were “working their way through” the former’s agreement with China to work out points of concern, New Zealand officials said.The paused funding — worth 18.2 million New Zealand dollars, or about $11 million — was for health, education and tourism; a separate $3 million in aid for cybersecurity is still being provided, according to New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Analysts said that the pause in aid was an extraordinary move by New Zealand. It is a different tack from Australia, which has dramatically increased aid spending in the region.Since 1965, the Cook Islands has been self-governing, but relies on New Zealand for defense. Cook Islanders hold New Zealand passports and the majority of them — nearly 85,000 — live in New Zealand. The parameters of their relationship are being tested as China has deepened its presence in the Pacific.ImageA tourist market on the main island of Rarotonga in June. Most travelers come from New Zealand. Credit...William West/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn 2022, China signed a security agreement with the Solomon Islands, another small Pacific nation, heightening fears that Beijing was aiming to establish a military foothold in the region. Both Chinese and Cook Islands officials have said that their pact does not include security or military matters.New Zealand’s intelligence chief, in a speech earlier this year, warned that China’s ambition in making inroads into the Pacific was to “link economic and security cooperation, create competing regional architectures.” China’s embassy in Wellington called his comments disinformation, saying there is no “secret agenda” to the Cook Islands agreement.David Capie, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington, said it was clear that New Zealand’s objections had to do with Beijing signaling increased military ambitions in the region.“In a different strategic context, that was fine. With different partners, that was probably fine,” he said. “The strategic context has changed.”The Cook Islands, one of the smallest of the Pacific island nations, has also been a focal point of emerging competition over seabed mining. The agreement with China included pledges to cooperate on exploring seabed minerals. The United States last month reached its own deal with the Cook Islands on mining the sea floor.Rashneel Kumar, editor of Cook Island News, which broke the news of New Zealand’s funding pause, said that, like other small Pacific island nations with developmental challenges and climate change risks, his country needed support wherever it could get it. All around Avarua, the capital, are physical reminders of this — the courthouse, the police headquarters, the national stadium, each built by China.“The feeling is there that China has helped us in some areas and we are grateful for that,” he said. “But the general consensus is, we should be careful who we partner with.”Victoria Kim is the Australia correspondent for The New York Times, based in Sydney, covering Australia, New Zealand and the broader Pacific region.Share full articleRelated ContentSKIP",

    "title": "Behind Castle Walls, the Rich and Powerful Celebrate Trump",
    "content": "SKIP As beggars’ banquets go, this one was pretty rich.There they sat, side-by-side, some of the wealthiest, most influential and best connected people in the world, all together at one long table inside a nearly-thousand-year-old castle. The guest of honor was in the middle of the table, wearing white tie, looking happier than ever. He was being treated like a king by an actual king.The state dinner that King Charles III hosted for President Trump on Wednesday night at Windsor Castle seemed like a new apex for Mr. Trump: a glittering showcase of the powerful outdoing themselves to get (or remain) on the good side of a president whose second term has been marked by demonstrations of brute power. Those demonstrations have increasingly taken the form of retribution against perceived enemies at home and tattered alliances abroad.“The bond between our two nations is indeed a remarkable one,” said Charles. “In renewing our bond tonight, we do so with unshakable trust in our friendship and in our shared commitment to independence and liberty.”The president seemed supremely pleased by the whole thing; he didn’t look the least bit bothered when the king used his speech to gently prod about environmental issues and the need to support Ukraine.Mr. Trump got up and cooed: “It’s a singular privilege to be the first American president welcomed here.” (Usually these dinners happen at Buckingham Palace back in London, but that old pile is undergoing renovations. Besides, Mr. Trump has already had one state dinner there, the last time he was president. And other U.S. presidents have been welcomed at the castle — including Mr. Trump in his first term — albeit not at a state dinner.)ImageOver 150 people attended the state dinner alongside King Charles III and President Trump.Credit...Pool photo by WpaBritain’s aim is clear: The royals were working in tandem with the British government, lavishing attention and honors on the president on Wednesday so that he might be more pliable in negotiations with America’s oldest ally in his diplomatic meeting with the prime minister on Thursday.But what about the rest of the table? There were 160 people sitting in that banquet room. And 1,452 pieces of cutlery, clanging and scraping in hands held by media barons, financiers, politicians and tech moguls. Peppered in between the power players were members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet and most senior White House aides.The seating chart for Wednesday’s dinner ought to be kept inside the castle and studied another thousand years from now as a fascinating document about the history of the West. This wasn’t a table of pop singers, movie stars, celebrities or fashion figures, whose company Mr. Trump has often sought. This was not about star power. It was about real power. Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, was seated beside the New York financier and chief executive of Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman. Bank of America’s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, sat on that side of the table. So did Silicon Valley’s boy-king of artificial intelligence, Sam Altman, who was put beside Kemi Badenoch, the leader of Britain’s Conservative Party. Demis Hassabis was there (he runs DeepMind, the secretive London A.I. lab owned by Google), and so was Satya Nadella, the top dog at Microsoft, and also Marc Benioff, the Salesforce co-founder. Tim Cook, the head of Apple, was there, too.Mr. Cook’s presence in particular seemed notable. It was just a few weeks ago that he appeared in the Oval Office, with cameras rolling, to give a beaming Mr. Trump a piece of handmade Corning glass in a 24-karat golden stand. It was a trophy meant to showcase his company’s investment in the U.S., but also to help patch up his relationship with Mr. Trump, who was irked when the Apple executive chose not to join his fellow tech titans in the Middle East last May for the president’s visit to the region. Mr. Trump took notice of Mr. Cook’s absence and publicly poked at him during two stops on the trip.ImageApple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and Mr. Trump’s daughter, Tiffany Trump, entering the state dinner at Windsor Castle on Wednesday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesAnd so, there was Mr. Cook on Wednesday, seated beside Tiffany Trump in the banquet hall. Other than the first lady, Melania Trump, who sat between Queen Camilla and Prince William, Tiffany and her husband were the only Trump relatives in attendance.But there was a dinner guest on Wednesday whose presence seemed especially telling. Across the table from Mr. Cook and a few places to the right sat media mogul Rupert Murdoch. He and Mr. Trump have a long and tangled on-again-off-again relationship. Things are definitely in the off mode at the moment: A few months ago, The Wall Street Journal — the crown jewel of Mr. Murdoch’s newspaper empire — broke a story about Mr. Trump’s former friendship with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, leading the president to deny the story and sue the paper and its owner. Mr. Trump’s suit became especially personal; he demanded, successfully, that the 94-year-old Mr. Murdoch provide updates about his health after the president pushed for him to be deposed within a matter of days.Mr. Murdoch’s position in the banquet hall was far enough down the table that he was out of the president’s field of vision, and yet, he was still there, sitting through a speech about Mr. Trump’s greatness. (Intriguingly, the newspaper baron was seated beside Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister’s chief of staff and right hand man who is currently taking a ton of heat in the media, most especially in the pages of — you guessed it — the Murdoch papers.)Windsor Castle is often described as the oldest and largest inhabited castle in the world, in almost continuous use since William I built it up in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest in 1066. There is a moat and thick stone walls and a maze of rooms. The soaring banquet hall contains the shields of the Knights of the Garter dating back to 1348. Polished suits of armor look down on the dining table from plinths carved into the walls.Outside those castle gates, Mr. Trump must return to a world that does not necessarily see him — or at least, will not necessarily treat him — the same way that the mighty men and women gathered at Windsor Castle did. Last week, when the president left the White House to have his first dinner out in Washington since his comeback, he got screamed at inside a restaurant by a band of protesters who, while supporting Gaza, compared him to Adolf Hitler. They were tossed out.Still, in Britain, the night before the state dinner, protesters beamed images of Mr. Trump socializing with Mr. Epstein onto the walls of the castle, a reminder of the political furor that awaits him back home.After all, fortresses are designed to keep the world out. And no banquet lasts forever.Shawn McCreesh is a White House reporter for The Times covering the Trump administration.Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent for The Times, reporting on President Trump.See more on: British Royal Family, Queen Camilla, King Charles III, Marc Benioff, Timothy Cook, Demis HassabisShare full articleRelated ContentSKIP",

    "content": "PinnedShawn McCreesh and Maggie HabermanReporting from Windsor and LondonHere’s the latest.President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, attended a lavish state dinner at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, where they were warmly received by the British royal family on the first day of an official visit heavy with pomp and grandeur.King Charles III welcomed President Trump to the banquet, saying the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom “has made us safer and stronger through the generations.”“Our people have fought and died together for the values we hold dear,” he added.For his part, Mr. Trump commended Charles for his environmentalism and his work “uplifting the poor.” He said being invited for a second state visit to the United Kingdom was one of the “highest honors” of his life. He also extolled about the “special relationship” between Britain and America, saying the word special “does not begin to do it justice.”With 160 guests attending, the banquet table was lined with power brokers from the worlds of technology, finance, media and government. White House aides were mixed in up and down the table with various lords and ladies of the English gentry.Earlier the president laid a wreath at Queen Elizabeth II’s tomb and watched a ceremony involving several military marching bands in full dress uniform on the East Lawn of the castle, while the Red Arrows, a Royal Air Force acrobatic team, flew over leaving red, white and blue contrails across the sky.The state visit is part of an effort by the British government to engage with a president who has returned to office less interested than ever in maintaining the post-World War II order and possibly divert him on key issues affecting the two nations. The fact that Mr. Trump has been invited to Britain for a second state visit — after his first in 2019 — is itself a rare diplomatic gesture that no other American president has enjoyed.In contrast to his red carpet reception from royalty and political leaders, thousands of demonstrators gathered in central London to protest the visit by Mr. Trump, who is unpopular in Britain, according to opinion polls. Some held placards reading “Dump Trump,” “Trump for Prison,” and “No to racism, No to Trump.”Here’s what else to know:Two-day visit: Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to sign a handful of deals on Thursday, and to hold a joint news conference. The Trumps plan to spend the night at Windsor Castle.U.K. upheaval: Over the weekend, the anti-immigrant agitator Tommy Robinson led a protest of more than 100,000 people through London — one of the largest far-right demonstrations in Britain’s history. Mr. Trump’s former adviser, Elon Musk, who has repeatedly amplified Mr. Robinson on social media, delivered a virtual address to the demonstrators in which he called for a change in government and used alarmist rhetoric about immigration, telling Britons: “Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you.” Mr. Starmer condemned the remarks.Epstein ties: Though Mr. Trump might have hoped to leave behind the political tensions at home, British activists protested his arrival on Tuesday by projecting a picture of the president with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the walls of Windsor Castle and unrolling a massive banner of the picture on the castle’s lawn. Last week, Mr. Starmer fired his ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, over his ties to Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Starmer were expected to face questions about the Epstein saga.Show moreSept. 17, 2025, 6:03 p.m. ETShawn McCreeshReporting from LondonHere’s who attended the state dinner at Windsor Castle.The banquet table was lined with power brokers from the worlds of technology, finance, sports and media, as well as government.

    "title": "U.K. Offers Trump a Royal Welcome of Maximum Pomp and Minimum Politics",
    "content": "SKIP President Trump received a pomp-filled royal welcome to Britain on Wednesday, feted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle during a two-day trip designed to be heavy on majesty and light on diplomacy.At a gilded dinner in the castle’s St. George’s Hall, the king toasted Mr. Trump, citing what he called the “enduring bond” between the peoples of Britain and the United States. And he noted that “British soil makes for rather splendid golf courses,” a nod to the two clubs Mr. Trump owns in Scotland.“Through the generations, our people have fought and died together for the values we hold dear,” Charles said. “We have celebrated together, mourned together and stood together in the best and worst of times.”Mr. Trump returned the praise, thanking the king and his wife, Queen Camilla, for their “extraordinary graciousness.” He said the two countries must defend “the exceptional heritage that makes us who we are, and we must continue to stand for the values and the people of the English-speaking world.”In a sign of how eagerly Britain is seeking to appeal to a president who has seemed intent on upending the post-World War II order, the visit marked the first time that an American leader has been invited to a second royal banquet. Mr. Trump attended a state banquet in 2019, and on Wednesday said he was honored to return for a second, saying, “That’s the first and maybe that’s going to be the last time. I hope it is actually.”But the closest either of the two toasts got to current affairs was the king’s effort to — gently — cajole Mr. Trump on the need for the United States and Britain to jointly defend Ukraine.“Our countries have the closest defense, security and intelligence relationship ever known,” he said. “In two world wars, we fought together to defeat the forces of tyranny. Today, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine, to deter aggression and secure peace.”Publicly at least, Wednesday was more about the trappings and grandeur of royalty, not the grim realities of a war-weary world.On his arrival at the castle Wednesday morning, accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, the president was welcomed by a guard of honor representing three colors: the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards. The three colors have never previously been assembled for a state visit, another sign of how the royal family was seeking to impress Mr. Trump.For the president, who has repeatedly expressed his love for a martial display, there were key moments planned throughout the day, including the royal salute as the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery marched past with their mounted guns and a spectacular flyover, with aerobatic jets known as the Red Arrows.ImageMr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, with King Charles III and Queen Camilla of the United Kingdom, at Windsor Castle on Wednesday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesWindsor Castle has been the site of two state visits this year: the one on Wednesday, and one for President Emmanuel Macron of France. Mr. Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland, has called it a singular gesture by the royal family. The president has said that his mother revered Queen Elizabeth II and watched her coronation in the early 1950s on television.After a private lunch, the Trumps met with Charles and Queen Camilla in the castle’s Green Drawing Room, viewing items from the Royal Collection that relate to the United States.“Wow,” Mr. Trump said as he looked at an item related to American independence. He and the king then looked at something related to a trans-Atlantic cable, according to reporters. The president turned to those reporters and asked, “Are you enjoying it, are you having a good time?”The Trumps and the royal couple also exchanged gifts. The king and queen gave Mr. Trump a leather-bound volume celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, as well as the Union Jack that flew over Buckingham Palace on the day of Mr. Trump’s second inauguration. The royal couple gave Mrs. Trump a silver and enamel bowl crafted by the Northern Ireland artist Cara Murphy, as well as a handbag designed by Anya Hindmarch.Mr. Trump gave the king a replica of one of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s swords, symbolizing the alliance of the United States and Britain during World War II. He gave the queen a Tiffany diamond and ruby flower brooch.ImageThe Trumps viewing items on display during a visit to the Royal Collection exhibition, in the Green Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, on Wednesday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesNot everyone in Britain was happy about Mr. Trump’s arrival in the country, or the royal treatment he received.British activists upset about the state visit protested his arrival on Tuesday by projecting a picture of Mr. Trump with Jeffrey Epstein on the walls of Windsor Castle and unrolling a massive banner of the picture on the castle’s grassy lawn.The police intervened to stop both political stunts quickly and made arrests over the projection. Representatives of the group behind the banner said they had achieved their goal of seeking to embarrass the president by noting his onetime friendship with the sex offender.In London on Wednesday night, drum-playing protesters stopped near Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s residence at 10 Downing Street, making a noisy protest against Mr. Trump’s visit. The building is protected by a line of police officers in front of security gates.And the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, launched a broadside against Mr. Trump and his administration in an opinion essay published in The Guardian shortly before Air Force One touched down on Tuesday night. Mr. Khan, a politician from Mr. Starmer’s Labour party who became the first Muslim to hold the position in 2016 and has since won two more mayoral elections in Britain’s capital, accused Mr. Trump of “fanning the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world,” continuing a long-running feud between the two men.ImageA protest against Mr. Trump’s visit, in London on Wednesday.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesMr. Trump took a swipe at Mr. Khan during his last visit to Britain in July, calling him “a nasty person” who has “done a terrible job.”When Mr. Trump was honored by Charles at the banquet, Ed Davey wasn’t there. The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats boycotted the dinner as a protest over Mr. Trump’s policies and the failure of the president to use his leverage over Israel to stop the war in Gaza.Mark Landler, Maggie Haberman, Shawn McCreesh, and Nader Ibrahim contributed reporting.Michael D.

What happened was that the booth-level officer there noted that her uncle's vote was deleted, so she checked who deleted her uncle's vote, and she found that it was a neighbour who deleted the vote. She asked her neighbour, but they said I did not delete any vote. Neither the person deleting the vote nor the person whose vote was deleted knew. Some other force hijacked the process and deleted the vote...\"Rahul Gandhi claimed that in Karnataka's Aland assembly constituency, 6,018 deletion applications were filed by impersonators to target Congress voters.This deletion of votes was done in \"centralised manner\" using software and not through individuals, the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha further said, adding that \"targeted deletion\" of votes was done in Congress stronghold through planned action.Gandhi also said that the Karnataka CID has started investigation seeking details from Election Commission on deletions done, but EC is not providing details. He urged, \"Gyanesh Kumar ji, do your job, and you have taken an oath. Give the details to the Karnataka CID.\"This press conference came 40 days after Rahul raised questions on the electoral outcome of Bangalore Central Lok Sabha seat, claiming that there was \"chori\" (stealing) of one lakh votes in Mahadevapura assembly seat during the 2024 polls. He had then claimed that the Election Commission was colluding with the BJP, which he called a \"crime\" against the Constitution.What about 'Hydrogen bomb'?Speaking about the so-called \"hydrogen bomb\" of revelations, Rahul Gandhi said, \"We will present the hydrogen bomb.\"He added, \"I told my team I would not step on stage without 100% proof.\"\"We will take two to three months to finish these presentations, and there will be no doubt that elections are being stolen across states in India,\" he said.Earlier, addressing the concluding event of his Voter Adhikar Yatra on September 1, Gandhi had said his party will soon come out with a \"hydrogen bomb\" of revelations about \"vote chori\" and after that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not be able to show his face to the country.Last month, Gandhi, citing data from the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, had claimed that over one lakh votes were \"stolen\" through manipulation in Mahadevapura assembly segment in Karnataka, and asserted that \"vote chori\" is an \"atom bomb on our democracy\".

Trump names 23 countries including India among major drug transits; check full listTOI World Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Sep 18, 2025, 09:15 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLarge US President Donald Trump (ANI) US President Donald Trump has identified China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and 19 other nations as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries, warning that their activities threaten the safety of the United States.In a Presidential Determination submitted to Congress on Monday, Trump listed these countries as sources or routes for illicit drugs entering the United States. According to the White House, Trump delivered the “Major’s List” to Congress, designating these countries as responsible for sourcing and transporting illicit drugs into the US, reported PTI.‘Drug War Is A False Pretext, Trump Only Seeks…’: Maduro Warns US Of Retaliation | WatchThe state department clarified that inclusion on the list does not necessarily reflect a government’s cooperation or counternarcotics work. It said the designation is based on “the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs or precursor chemicals to be transited or produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control and law enforcement measures.”23 countries on Trump’s drug listAfghanistanThe BahamasBelizeBoliviaBurmaChinaColombiaCosta RicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEl SalvadorGuatemalaHaitiHondurasIndiaJamaicaLaosMexicoNicaraguaPakistanPanamaPeruVenezuelaAccording to the White House, these countries are either sources of illicit drug production or serve as major transit points for trafficking into the US.Nations that ‘failed demonstrably’The state department said five countries – Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and Venezuela – have “failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts” to meet international counternarcotics obligations.It also clarified that inclusion on the list “does not necessarily reflect a government’s counterdrug efforts or level of cooperation with the United States,” but is based on geographic and economic factors that enable drug flows.Trump’s warning to ChinaTrump singled out China as the “world's largest source” of precursor chemicals used in illicit fentanyl production. He said China is also a major supplier of synthetic narcotics including nitazenes and methamphetamine.“The Chinese leadership can and must take stronger and sustained action to cut down these chemical flows and prosecute the drug criminals facilitating them,” Trump said.Taliban’s role in Afghanistan drug tradeOn Afghanistan, Trump said the Taliban’s announced ban on drugs has not stopped ongoing production and stockpiles of narcotics.“Revenue from this drug trade funds transnational criminal groups and supports international terrorists. Some members of the Taliban continue to profit from this trade, and I am once again designating Afghanistan as having failed demonstrably to uphold its drug control obligations,” he said.Trump added that trafficking of fentanyl and other deadly illicit drugs has created a national emergency. “Transnational organised crime's trafficking of fentanyl and other deadly illicit drugs into the US has created a national emergency, including a public health crisis that remains the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 44,” he said, as quoted by PTI.About the AuthorTOI World DeskAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

None of them had any safety equipment. When the first worker collapsed after inhaling poisonous fumes, another went in to save him and died. The third, who tried to rescue the two, lost consciousness. Police called the manager of a company, which engaged the three on contractual basis, for questioning. They registered a case under several sections, including one banning manual scavenging.'No mask, oxygen or even cloth given to cover face' According to police, information about the people falling inside a sewer near Harihar apartments was received via a PCR call at Ashok Vihar police station at 11.30pm.\"Arvind, along with three others, Sonu and Narayan, also from Kasganj, and Naresh from Bihar, entered a sewer as part of ongoing cleaning work when they fell unconscious, allegedly due to toxic gases,\" a senior police officer said.Arvind was rushed to DDU Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The other two, Sonu(45) and Naresh (30) remain in critical condition in the ICU.At Deep Chand Babu Hospital's ICU ward, Narayan (32), one of the workers, told TOI, \"I was the one who opened the lid of the sewer that day,\" he said. \"After that, Sonu was told to go inside. We had tied a rope around his waist, but no safety equipment was provided to him. He wasn't given any mask, no oxygen, not even a cloth to cover his face. He was just asked to go down and cut a pipe that was inside the sewer for some repair and cleaning work.\"The moment Sonu cut the pipe, we saw him collapse. He just fell unconscious inside. To save him, Arvind immediately tied himself with the same rope and went in. But as soon as he reached down, he too fell unconscious. After that, Naresh tried to go in and bring them out, but the same thing happened to him. One after another, all three of them collapsed inside that sewer,\" Narayan said. \"I raised an alarm and shouted for help. Some locals gathered and together we somehow managed to pull them out with the rope. But by then all three were completely unconscious. They went in only to save each other. That's how we lost him.\" Arvind was the sole breadwinner of his family, which includes his wife and two young sons aged 12 and 7. His daily earnings ranged between Rs 500 and Rs 800 and the family depended entirely on that income. For the past 15 years, he had been doing contractual work, often travelling to Delhi and taking up odd jobs. Sonu, too, is the only earning member in his family and supports his two sons, aged one-and-a-half and five. At the spot, the manhole on the busy residential stretch lay open the next day, access to it blocked only by a police barricade. Scattered around were the belongings of the workers, slippers, broken bluetooth headsets and a lone slipper floating inside the manhole's dirty sewer water. \"Preliminary inquiries revealed that the sewer cleaning work was underway for several days, carried out under the supervision of a construction company,\" police officer added.About the AuthorDevanshi MehtaDevanshi Mehta is a crime correspondent uncovering Delhi’s unseen crisis—addiction, systemic violence, and the quiet suffering of women, children, and marginalised communities.

Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin's fiercest foe, died in the Arctic penal colony in February 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated. Authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk but have otherwise given few details on his death. He was 47. In a video released Wednesday, Yulia Navalnaya said that biological samples from Navalny's body had been taken out of Russia and tested at two laboratories abroad. She said that both laboratories concluded that Navalny had been poisoned, but had not released their findings due to \"political considerations.\" \"These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,\" Navalnaya said in the video, which was posted on social media. In the clip, she questioned the lack of video footage from the prison and showed images purported to be of Navalny's cell on the day of his death showing vomit on the floor. She did not provide direct proof that Navalny had been poisoned or that it had been carried out by prison authorities. \"I demand that the laboratories that conducted the research publish their results,\" she said. \"Stop appeasing Putin for some higher 'considerations.' You cannot placate him. While you stay silent, he does not stop,\" Navalnaya said. Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny's death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied. In a press conference Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he was not aware of Navalnaya's statement and said that he could not comment. Navalnaya said in August 2024 that she was told by Russian investigators that Navalny died from a combination of \"a dozen different diseases\" and that he finally succumbed to arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat. Navalnaya disputed Russian officials' version of events and said her husband exhibited no instances of heart disease while alive. Navalny previously suffered from another poisoning in 2020, when the opposition leader fell sick on an internal flight in Russia. He was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have denied any involvement in the incident, a claim that Navalny challenged as false.End of Article Social Media Visual Stories PreviousShubhangi Atre’s aesthetically glowing lookstvNeha Sharma turns heads with her chic fashion choicesEntertainmentIn pics: Stylish looks of Shalini PandeyEntertainmentKalyani Priyadarshan: Draped in elegance, framed in poetryEntertainmentTeam Conrad fashion: Steal Christopher Briney’s wardrobe from ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty’LifestyleFrom basics to real change: Tamannaah Bhatia’s weight loss journeyEntertainment10 baby girl names inspired by goddess DurgaLifestyle10 quotes on love and longing by Shakespeare that still tug the heartLifestyleNature’s ‘Demolition Experts’ :Why these 7 animals break their own houseLifestyle8 omega-3-rich vegetarian foods to boost kids’ memoryLifestyle Next123VideosTrump's 'Weird Act' Stuns King Charles During Royal Event In WindsorPennsylvania Horror: Codorus Township Shootout Leaves 3 Officers Dead, 2 Critical; Gunman EliminatedSaudi Inks Huge Defence Pact With Nuclear Pakistan After Israeli Attack On Qatar | Key HighlightsBig Fight Over 'Political Murders', Congress Erupts; 'Charlie NOT Killed For His Words But...'Hamas Leader Targeted By Israel In Qatar Appears On TV To Reveal How They Survived Israeli StrikeOn Cam: Iran Releases Dramatic Video Of Man Executed On Charges Of Spying For Israel'You've Any Idea How Law Works?': Kash Patel HAMMERS Jamie Raskin Over Trump Epstein Files'Trump In Epstein Files': Kash Patel's 'WILD CONFESSION' Amid Heavy Clash In U.S. House | WATCHKash Patel 'Takes Credit' For Catching Charlie Kirk Assassin In 33 Hrs; 'Walked The Crime Scene'Shocking Kash Patel Vs Jayapal WILD FIGHT; Tables Thumped Amid Epstein Scre",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump arrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement and face more than 30 criminal charges in a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment. News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast the Tuesday arraignment, a judge ruled Monday night. Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look to challenge “every potential issue” once the indictment is unsealed. Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election. All Catch Up 34 Posts Our live coverage of Trump’s historic indictment has moved. Link Copied! Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.” In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms. Link Copied! News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin. Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom. However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.” Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position. The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.” Trump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week. The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public. The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies. Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped. Link Copied! Donald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward the prosecutor and judge presiding over the case. But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well as other investigations he is facing during a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night. It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to his legal case and his political campaign, which are now inextricably linked. Link Copied!

Santiago/Getty Images) Alina Habba, who represents Donald Trump in several civil matters, spent time with the former president in New York today and said, “He’s in good spirits. Honestly, he’s as he normally would be. He’s ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow.” Habba — appearing on on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters” — was asked about the “game plan” for Trump’s appearance in court in Manhattan Tuesday and said, “It’s all mapped out.” She added, “Barring any surprises, I think that it should be smooth. We’re trying to coordinate and cooperate with everybody to make sure that there are no problems.” On whether Trump can get a fair trial in Manhattan, Habba said, “No, no. I think it’s very difficult. I’d like to have faith in this state, but I’ve been practicing for him now for a couple years and gone to court in New York for a few years, and I can tell you, it’s not the same as representing anybody else.” Link Copied!

(Reuters/Getty Images) Former President Donald Trump met with his attorneys Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina at Trump Tower after arriving in New York City Monday, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN. It is unclear if the newest addition to Trump’s New York legal team, Todd Blanche, attended the meeting. Trump is expected to be arraigned Tuesday. Link Copied! Former President Donald Trump has landed in New York’s La Guardia Airport ahead of his expected Tuesday arraignment in a Manhattan courthouse. History was made Thursday when he was indicted by a New York grand jury. It’s the first time that a current or former US president has been criminally charged. The Manhattan district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme and cover-up involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump’s attorney said he plans to file “substantial” legal challenges. The former president has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in the matter and accused Democrats of targeting him politically.

Now that he is inside the building — where he launched his presidential bid nearly eight years ago — Trump is expected to meet with lawyers and political advisers on the eve of his arraignment, an aide told CNN. Trump’s mood was described by an adviser as “defiant and focused,” as he watched expansive television coverage while flying back to his native New York City from Florida. Link Copied!

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield on Monday described Russia assuming the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency this month as “an April Fool’s joke.” Greenfield said she is not surprised if the Russians asked the foreign minister to come to UNSC headquarters in New York but also said council does work beyond Ukraine. “We haven’t decided yet on what our attendance levels will be, but we intend to carry out the business of the Security Council during this month. The Security Council does more than Ukraine. We work on many issues, and we again expect that Russia will carry their presidency in a professional way, but when they don’t, we will stand ready to call them out,” Greenfield said. Link Copied!

He said there were no complaints in February 2022 when Russia was last president of the council, while Russia invaded and pointed out that the US was president of the council in 2003 — the year Iraq was invaded. The ambassador said as long as world order is maintained, there will not be any change in UN procedures that might lead to a change in Russia’s status. Russia took over presidency on Saturday of the UN’s top security body, which rotates every month.

Eva Sakellarides/Paris Match/Getty Images CNN — French government minister Marlene Schiappa has come under fire from members of her own party after appearing on the front cover of Playboy magazine. Schiappa, who has been a government minister since 2017, appeared on the cover of the magazine to accompany a 12-page interview she did on women’s and LGBT rights. Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress. Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street. Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne. Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister. France is currently in the throes of a political and social crisis triggered by French President Emmanuel Macron’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition.

France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday. Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.” French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.” “I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.",

Now, it’s enjoying a comeback. Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year. The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December. This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns. Inflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach. The pound turnaround The pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom. The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly. “There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING. But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year. “There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said. The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole. Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States. A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month. Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now. “In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.",

    "title": "Hundreds of millions at risk from Chinese shopping app malware",
    "content": "CNN — It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month. But according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings. And once installed, it’s tough to remove. While many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level. In a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff. Multiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales. “We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm. “This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.” Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices. Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security. Some American lawmakers are pushing for a national ban on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew was grilled by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government. The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is topping US download charts and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China. While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion. There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, there are concerns from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities. Pinduoduo's parent company PDD is listed on the Nasdaq in New York. Mike Segar/Reuters/File The findings follow Google’s suspension of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app. An ensuing report from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app. Pinduoduo has previously rejected “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.” CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response. Rise to success Pinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and a market value three times that of eBay (EBAY), wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth. Founded in 2015 in Shanghai by Colin Huang, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD). It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas. Pinduoduo posted triple digit growth in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year it listed in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its earnings reports. Colin Huang, a former Google employee, founded Pinduoduo in 2015 in Shanghai. He stepped down as CEO in 2020 and resigned as chairman the following year. VCG/VCG/Getty Images/File It was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit. According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai. “The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said. By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source. This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said. The team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light. PDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team. What experts found Approached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February. Google Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app. The researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts. “Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen. In China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the Android system. Luo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG/Getty Images The app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added. Check Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny. The app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.

    "title": "A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise",
    "content": "Researchers are working on new alternatives to injected vaccines for Covid-19. Hou Yu/China News Service/VCG/Getty Images CNN — Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the virus gets its first foothold in the body. In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic. Young Female doctor in protective mask injecting or prepairing for injecting vaccine against coronavirus or ncov 19 or covid into patient's arm Adobe Stock Related article WHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low risk Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials. China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people. Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life. As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised. Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat. Adobe Stock Related article China approves its first mRNA Covid-19 vaccine One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells. It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin. The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response. “If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said. Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants. The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals. The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick. “You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said. Promising results in animal studies In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells. The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection. The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets. As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.

REUTERS/Hannah Beier Hannah Beier/Reuters Related article Health officials consider another round of bivalent boosters for the most vulnerable Americans “They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research. The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update. It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials. Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done. In reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus. “That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said. More on the way At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, according to the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker. The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.

Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.” They are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy. “We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies. During the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University. But when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission. Some, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary. A group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protests by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field. CNN Others have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field. While Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation. “We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said. video Related video Palestinian taxi driver recounts surviving attack by right-wing protesters Fellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests. They’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation. “The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.” Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle. Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition. But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000. Israelis protest during a demonstration after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in Jerusalem, on March 27, 2023. Ilan Rosenberg/Reuters Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.” In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security. Under pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.” “Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added. But Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said. Many protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms. “We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said.",

    "content": "Video Ad Feedback HSBC may have to choose between China and the West 03:31 - Source: CNN Business HSBC may have to choose between China and the West 03:31 • CNN Business Hong Kong CNN — HSBC’s top brass defended their strategy Monday to frustrated shareholders in the lender’s largest market, as Europe’s biggest bank continued to face calls to be split up. At an informal shareholder meeting in Hong Kong, Chairman Mark Tucker and CEO Noel Quinn took questions from investors on issues ranging from how the bank was approaching demands for an overhaul of its business to its purchase of Silicon Valley Bank’s UK arm. In prepared remarks, Tucker and Quinn each reiterated the board’s recommendation that shareholders vote against a resolution on the docket for its annual general meeting in May that would force the bank to come up with a plan to spin off or reorganize its Asian business — the lender’s main source of profits. A sign sits on the HSBC Holdings Plc headquarters office building in the Canary Wharf business, financial and shopping district of London, U.K., on Friday, Sept. 18, 2020. After a pause during lockdown, lenders from Citigroup Inc. to HSBC Holdings Plc have restarted cuts, taking gross losses announced this year to a combined 63,785 jobs, according to a Bloomberg analysis of filings. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images Simon Dawson/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article HSBC's biggest shareholder reignites debate about breaking up the bank Tucker said the board was unanimous in its opposition to the resolution, stating plainly: “It would not be in your interest to split the bank.” He said the board had previously reviewed a range of options for restructuring the bank, and concluded that such alternatives would “materially destroy value for shareholders,” including dividends. “Our strategy is working,” Tucker told the room of more than 1,000 shareholders. “Our current strategy is moving dividends up.” Calls for a breakup HSBC has been facing calls to separate its Asian business from the rest of the bank over the past year. Shareholders in Hong Kong — where HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors’ portfolios — contend that the London-based lender’s performance has been dragged down by its businesses in other regions. Quinn addressed those complaints head-on Monday, saying “our profits in Hong Kong and the UK are no longer being dragged down by underperformance elsewhere. The group is performing well as a whole.” Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss” because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions. Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, left, and Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, departing following the bank's shareholders meeting in Hong Kong on Monday. Paul Yeung/Bloomberg/Getty Images Investors have also been unhappy with HSBC scrapping its dividend in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions. Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation. “Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN. “That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.” Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender bringing back its dividend in 2021, albeit at a lower level.

Louise Delmotte/Bloomberg/Getty Images Ken Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday. The resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue. Lui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.” His group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added. The Ping An question HSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder. Ping An (PNGAY), China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure. In a series of remarks made public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve HSBC’s performance and value.” Since then, the insurance giant’s views haven’t changed, according to a person familiar with the matter. The source told CNN that Ping An has been calling for HSBC to explore a reorganization, with an eye on boosting its valuation and simplifying its regulatory obligations around the globe. The insurer has not recommended a specific path forward but will support any initiatives, including a spinoff of its Asian business, that could boost its stock performance or value, the person added. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting. Banking sector turmoil HSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had scooped up the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded. Critics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together. “Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong. HSBC's London headquarters, pictured here on 14th October 2022, has bought up SVB's UK arm Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty Images Related article HSBC buys SVB's UK business, ending 'nightmare' for British tech Quinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers. They pushed back on the notion that management hadn’t had time to carry out proper due diligence. Tucker also weighed in on recent tumult in the banking industry, saying he did not expect an “immediate impact” on HSBC. “After the collapse of a number of smaller regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse, the share prices of all banks have been suppressed,” he noted. But he said he did not believe such developments represented “a systemic risk” to the sector. “I do expect a period of uncertainty” before nerves settle, he added.",

The group known as OPEC+ announced Sunday it would cut oil production by more than 1.6 million barrels a day starting in May, running through the end of the year. The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday. The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading. “I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.” The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC. “We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast. The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a record $5.02 a gallon on June 14, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the average price fell every day. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline. General view of Saudi Aramco's Ras Tanura oil refinery and oil terminal in Saudi Arabia May 21, 2018. Ahmed Jadallah/Reuters Related article Oil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts Even at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up. “They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. CNN — Last year, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke at a white nationalist event organized by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that caused Republican leaders to denounce her. Dean Obeidallah CNN Last week, Greene’s Twitter account was temporarily suspended by the Elon Musk-headed platform over a tweet with a graphic referring to a “Trans Day of Vengeance,” as she denounced a planned transgender rights rally. And come Tuesday, Greene has announced plans to protest in New York City when former President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned on an indictment of more than 30 counts, calling the proceedings against him an “unconstitutional WITCH HUNT!” But on Sunday, Greene was featured on CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview the long-running show promoted on Twitter with the tease: “Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, nicknamed MTG, isn’t afraid to share her opinions, no matter how intense and in-your-face they are. She sits down with Lesley Stahl this Sunday on 60 Minutes.” The images attached to this tweet by “60 Minutes” include Greene and Stahl walking through the US Capitol, taking a stroll outside and Greene showing Stahl something on her phone. ROME, GA - MAY 24: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) addresses supporters during a primary election watch party on May 24, 2022 in Rome, Georgia. Greene is running for a second term in Georgia's 14th congressional district after defeating five Republican challengers in today's primary. (Photo by Jessica McGowan/Getty Images) Jessica McGowan/Getty Images Related article It's time for Marjorie Taylor Greene to go In the segment that aired Sunday night, Stahl noted the congresswoman had moved from the fringe to the GOP’s front row in two years despite a “sharp tongue” and “some pretty radical views” as well as “over the top” comments such as “the Democrats are a party of pedophiles.” Stahl also referred to video of Greene chasing a Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor, still maintaining that the 2020 election was stolen and failing to criticize Trump over spending. (The interview was conducted before news of his indictment.) But Stahl didn’t mention Greene spoke at a white nationalist event a year ago while a member of Congress or her extreme anti-Muslim views and her defense of January 6 rioters. Criticism of CBS for amplifying Greene has been swift and well-deserved even before the program aired. Former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted beforehand: “Wow. Insane that 60 min would do this.” (Kinzinger is a CNN senior political commentator.) Journalist Molly Jong-Fast also slammed “60 Minutes” with the tweet: “Attention is currency and 60 minutes is spending its currency on the Jewish space lasers woman.” (Jong-Fast was apparently referring to Greene’s past claim that a massive California wildfire was started by “a laser” beamed from space controlled by a prominent Jewish banking family.) David Hogg, who survived the 2018 horrific school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has since become an activist against gun violence, responded, “I look forward to your questions about why she thinks school shootings are fake and why she’s supported QAnon.” Former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before his speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center on March 4, 2023 in National Harbor, Maryland. Trump took questions from reporters over a range of topics including on the progress of his campaign and his opinions on the war in Ukraine. Conservatives gathered at the four-day annual conference to discuss the agenda of the Republican Party. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Related article Trump's risky call for protests Greene amplified the conspiracy theory — two years before being elected to Congress — that the Parkland shooting that took 17 lives was staged. And in 2019, Greene appeared on video confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a “coward.” She also called Hogg “#littleHitler” on social media. Greene’s own tweet promoting Sunday’s segment was not filled with her typical smears of “fake news” when she doesn’t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised “60 Minutes” host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): “It was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.” Greene added, “Leslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism. And while we may disagree on some issues, I respect her greatly.” Now, it is true that “60 Minutes” over its 50-plus-year history has featured what the show has dubbed “controversial” guests. These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose 1995 terrorist attack left 168 dead, including 19 children. And the show did a 1979 interview with Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Perhaps “60 Minutes” views Greene — who has repeatedly downplayed and even defended the January 6, 2021, attack plus called for the GOP to become the party of “Christian nationalism” — in the vein of its long list of controversial guests. (CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.) Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook However, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the comments of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” Moonves added, “The money’s rolling in and this is fun. … (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,” concluding, “Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Don...",

    "content": "Ryyan Alshebl, who left his hometown of As Suwayda in south-western Syria in 2015, ran as an independent in the municipality of Ostelsheim. Lukas Barth/Reuters CNN — A Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2015 has won a mayoral election in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg. Ryyan Alshebl, who left his hometown of As Suwayda in Syria eight years ago, ran as an independent in the municipality of Ostelsheim. He won 55.41% of the votes on Sunday, beating two German candidates, Marco Strauss and Mathias Fey. Locals cheered the 29-year-old when he welcomed his win, a victory he described as “sensational,” German local broadcaster SWR reported Monday. “Today, Ostelsheim sent an example for broad-mindedness and cosmopolitanism for the whole of Germany,” he said, according to to German public broadcaster ZDF. “That’s not something that can be taken for granted in a conservative, rural area.” Alshebl’s first call after his victory was to his mother in Syria, who was thrilled with the news, SWR reported. The Association of Municipalities of Baden-Württemberg said Alshebl is the first man with Syrian roots to run for and win a mayor’s office. He will start his role in June. Ivana Kottasova/CNN Related article 'You are not a refugee.' Roma refugees fleeing war in Ukraine say they are suffering discrimination and prejudice Ostelsheim residents have welcomed their incoming mayor. “The fairy tale has come true, and the right man has become our mayor,” Annette Keck, who lives in the village, told SWR. Strauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook. The state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said. Not everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail. The young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF. ‘Investing in your future’ Born to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website. At the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from home by late 2015 – about half of Syria’s pre-war population. Alshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website. While many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy. Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.

He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities. Flexible childcare and climate protections are also on his agenda. Alshebl, who is a member of the Green Party and now has German citizenship, pledged during his campaign that once elected as mayor he would move to Ostelsheim.",

    "title": "Kwame Brathwaite, photographer of 'Black is Beautiful' movement, dies at 85",
    "content": "Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Art Newspaper, an editorial partner of CNN Style. CNN — Kwame Brathwaite, the pioneering activist and photographer whose work helped define the aesthetics of the “Black is Beautiful” movement of the 1960s and beyond, died on April 1, aged 85. His son, Kwame Brathwaite, Jr, announced his father’s death in an Instagram post that read in part, “I am deeply saddened to share that my Baba, the patriarch of our family, our rock and my hero has transitioned.” Brathwaite’s work has been the subject of resurgent interest from curators, historians and collectors in recent years, and his first major institutional retrospective, which was organized by the Aperture Foundation, made its debut in 2019 at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles before touring the country. Kwame Brathwaite Cory Rice Brathwaite was born in 1938 to Barbadian immigrants, in what he referred to as “the People’s Republic of Brooklyn” in New York, though his family moved from there to Harlem and then to the South Bronx when Brathwaite was 5 years old. He attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) and, according to profiles of Brathwaite in T Magazine and Vice, was drawn to photography by two moments. The first was in August of 1955, when a 17-year-old Brathwaite encountered David Jackson’s haunting photograph of a brutalized Emmett Till in his open casket. The second was in 1956, when — after he and his brother Elombe co-founded the African Jazz Arts Society and Studios (AJASS) — Brathwaite saw a young man taking photos in a dark jazz club without the use of a flash, and his mind became alight with possibility. Brathwaite's photograph of models who embraced their natural hair, photographed in 1966. Courtesy The Kwame Brathwaite Archive Using a Hasselblad medium-format camera, Brathwaite attempted to do the same, learning to work with limited light in a manner that enhanced the visual narrative of his imagery. He would soon also develop a darkroom technique that enriched and deepened how Black skin would appear in his photography, honing the practice in a small darkroom in his Harlem apartment. Brathwaite went on to photograph jazz legends performing throughout the 1950s and ’60s, including Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and others. “You want to get the feeling, the mood that you’re experiencing when they’re playing,” Brathwaite told Aperture Magazine in 2017. “That’s the thing. You want to capture that.” Related article A 106-year-old from the Philippines is Vogue's oldest ever cover model By the early 1960s, alongside the rest of AJASS, Brathwaite began using his photography and organizing prowess to consciously push back against whitewashed, Eurocentric beauty standards. The group came up with the concept of the Grandassa Models, young Black women whom Brathwaite would photograph, celebrating and accentuating their features. In 1962, AJASS organized “Naturally ’62”, a fashion show held in a Harlem club called the Purple Manor and featuring the models. The show would go on to be held regularly until 1992. In 1966, Brathwaite married his wife Sikolo, a Grandassa Model whom he had met on the street the year prior when he asked if he could take her portrait. The two remained married for the rest of Brathwaite’s life. Women in a car gathered for Garvey Day, the annual event commemorating Black activist Marcus Garvey. Courtesy The Kwame Brathwaite Archive By the 1970s, Brathwaite’s focus on jazz shifted to other forms of popular Black music. In 1974, he traveled to Africa with the Jackson Five to document their tour, also photographing the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo that same year. Commissions in this era also saw Brathwaite photographing Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Bob Marley and other music legends.

In 2016, Brathwaite joined the roster of Philip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles, and he was continuing to photograph commissions as recently as 2018, when he shot artist and stylist Joanne Petit-Frère for The New Yorker. T Magazine’s 2021 profile, published on the occasion of Brathwaite’s retrospective traveling to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, noted that the photographer’s health was failing such that he was unable to be interviewed for the article. A separate exhibition, “Kwame Brathwaite: Things Well Worth Waiting For,” is currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it will remain until July 24.
